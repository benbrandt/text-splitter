    ///
    /// To preserve as much semantic meaning within a chunk as possible, a
    /// recursive approach is used, starting at larger semantic units and, if that is
    /// too large, breaking it up into the next largest unit. Here is an example of the
    /// steps used:
    ///
    /// 1. Split the text by a given level
    /// 2. For each section, does it fit within the chunk size?
    ///   a. Yes. Merge as many of these neighboring sections into a chunk as possible to maximize chunk length.
    ///   b. No. Split by the next level and repeat.
    ///
    /// The boundaries used to split the text if using the top-level `chunks` method, in descending length:
    ///
    /// 1. [Headings](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#atx-headings) - in descending levels
    /// 2. [Thematic Breaks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#thematic-break)
    /// 3. Progress through the `TextSplitter::chunks` method.
