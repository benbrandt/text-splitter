- "Two households, both alike in dignity,"
- "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,"
- From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
- ",\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands unclean."
- From forth the fatal loins of these two
- foes
- A pair of star-cross’d lovers take
- their life;
- Whose misadventur’d piteous
- overthrows
- Doth with their death bury their parents’
- strife.
- The fearful passage of their death-mark’d
- "love,"
- And the continuance of their parents’
- "rage,"
- "Which, but their children’s end,"
- "nought could remove,"
- Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage
- ;
- "The which, if you with patient ears attend,"
- "What here shall miss, our toil shall"
- strive to mend.
- "[_Exit._]\n\n\n\nACT I"
- SCENE I. A public place.
- Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and
- "bucklers.\n\nSAMPSON."
- "Gregory, on my word, we’ll not"
- "carry coals.\n\nGREGORY."
- "No, for then we should be colliers"
- ".\n\nSAMPSON."
- "I mean, if we be in choler"
- ", we’ll draw."
- GREGORY.
- "Ay, while you live, draw your neck"
- out o’ the collar.
- SAMPSON.
- "I strike quickly, being moved."
- GREGORY.
- But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
- SAMPSON.
- A dog of the house of Montague moves me
- ".\n\nGREGORY."
- To move is to stir; and to be
- "valiant is to stand: therefore, if"
- thou
- "art moved, thou runn’st away"
- ".\n\nSAMPSON."
- A dog of that house shall move me to stand
- "."
- I will take the wall of any man or maid
- of Montague’s.
- GREGORY.
- "That shows thee a weak slave, for the"
- weakest goes to the wall.
- SAMPSON.
- "True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels"
- ", are ever thrust to"
- "the wall: therefore I will push"
- "Montague’s men from the wall, and"
- thrust his maids to the wall.
- GREGORY.
- The quarrel is between our masters and us
- "their men.\n\nSAMPSON."
- "’Tis all one, I will show myself"
- "a tyrant: when I have fought with"
- the
- "men I will be civil with the maids,"
- I will cut off their heads.
- GREGORY.
- The heads of the maids?
- SAMPSON.
- "Ay, the heads of the maids,"
- or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
- "thou wilt.\n\nGREGORY."
- They must take it in sense that feel it.
- SAMPSON.
- Me they shall feel while I am able to stand
- ": and ’tis known I am a"
- pretty piece of flesh.
- GREGORY.
- ’Tis well thou art not fish; if
- "thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John"
- "."
- Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of
- Montagues.
- Enter Abram and Balthasar
- ".\n\nSAMPSON."
- "My naked weapon is out: quarrel,"
- I will back thee.
- GREGORY.
- How? Turn thy back and run?
- "SAMPSON.\nFear me not."
- GREGORY.
- "No, marry; I fear thee!"
- SAMPSON.
- Let us take the law of our sides; let
- "them begin.\n\nGREGORY."
- "I will frown as I pass by, and let"
- them take it as they list.
- SAMPSON.
- "Nay, as they dare."
- "I will bite my thumb at them, which is"
- disgrace to
- "them if they bear it.\n\nABRAM."
- "Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
- SAMPSON.
- "I do bite my thumb, sir."
- ABRAM.
- "Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
- SAMPSON.
- Is the law of our side if I say
- ay?
- "GREGORY.\nNo."
- SAMPSON.
- "No sir, I do not bite my thumb at"
- "you, sir; but I bite my thumb,"
- "sir.\n\nGREGORY."
- "Do you quarrel, sir?"
- ABRAM.
- "Quarrel, sir? No, sir."
- SAMPSON.
- "But if you do, sir, I am for"
- you.
- I serve as good a man as you.
- "ABRAM.\nNo better."
- "SAMPSON.\nWell, sir."
- Enter Benvolio.
- GREGORY.
- Say better; here comes one of my
- master’s kinsmen.
- SAMPSON.
- "Yes, better, sir."
- "ABRAM.\nYou lie."
- SAMPSON.
- "Draw, if you be men."
- "Gregory, remember thy washing blow."
- "[_They fight._]"
- BENVOLIO.
- "Part, fools!"
- "put up your swords, you know not what you"
- do.
- "[_Beats down their swords._]"
- "Enter Tybalt.\n\nTYBALT."
- "What, art thou drawn among these heartless"
- hinds?
- "Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death"
- ".\n\nBENVOLIO."
- "I do but keep the peace, put up thy"
- "sword,"
- Or manage it to part these men with me.
- TYBALT.
- "What, drawn, and talk of peace?"
- I hate the word
- "As I hate hell, all Montagues,"
- "and thee:\nHave at thee, coward."
- "[_They fight._]"
- Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.
- FIRST CITIZEN.
- "Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike!"
- Beat them down!
- Down with the Capulets!
- Down with the Montagues!
- "Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady"
- "Capulet.\n\nCAPULET."
- What noise is this?
- "Give me my long sword, ho!"
- LADY CAPULET.
- "A crutch, a crutch!"
- Why call you for a sword?
- CAPULET.
- "My sword, I say!"
- "Old Montague is come,"
- And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
- Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.
- MONTAGUE.
- Thou villain Capulet!
- "Hold me not, let me go."
- LADY MONTAGUE.
- Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek
- a foe.
- "Enter Prince Escalus, with"
- "Attendants.\n\nPRINCE."
- "Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,"
- "Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,"
- "—\nWill they not hear? What, ho!"
- "You men, you beasts,"
- That quench the fire of your pernicious
- "rage\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,"
- "On pain of torture, from those bloody hands"
- Throw your mistemper’d weapons
- to the ground
- And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
- "Three civil brawls, bred of an"
- "airy word,"
- "By thee, old Capulet, and Montague"
- ","
- Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our
- "streets,\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens"
- "Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,"
- "To wield old partisans, in hands as"
- "old,"
- "Canker’d with peace, to part your"
- canker’d hate.
- "If ever you disturb our streets again,"
- Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
- ".\nFor this time all the rest depart away:"
- "You, Capulet, shall go along with me"
- ",\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,"
- "To know our farther pleasure in this case,"
- "To old Free-town, our common judgement-"
- place.
- "Once more, on pain of death, all men"
- depart.
- "[_Exeunt Prince and Attendants"
- "; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt"
- ",\n Citizens and Servants._]"
- MONTAGUE.
- Who set this ancient quarrel new
- abroach?
- "Speak, nephew, were you by when it began"
- "?\n\nBENVOLIO."
- Here were the servants of your adversary
- "And yours, close fighting ere I did approach"
- "."
- "I drew to part them, in the instant came"
- "The fiery Tybalt, with his sword"
- "prepar’d,"
- "Which, as he breath’d defiance to my"
- "ears,"
- "He swung about his head, and cut the winds"
- ","
- "Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him"
- in scorn.
- While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
- "Came more and more, and fought on part and"
- "part,"
- "Till the Prince came, who parted either part."
- LADY MONTAGUE.
- "O where is Romeo, saw you him today?"
- Right glad I am he was not at this
- "fray.\n\nBENVOLIO."
- "Madam, an hour before the"
- worshipp’d sun
- Peer’d forth the golden window of the
- "east,"
- "A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,"
- Where underneath the grove of sycamore
- "That westward rooteth from this city side,"
- So early walking did I see your son.
- "Towards him I made, but he was ware"
- "of me,"
- And stole into the covert of the wood.
- "I, measuring his affections by my own,"
- Which then most sought where most might not be found
- ",\nBeing one too many by my weary self,"
- "Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing"
- "his,"
- And gladly shunn’d who
- gladly fled from me.
- MONTAGUE.
- "Many a morning hath he there been seen,"
- With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s
- "dew,"
- Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
- ;
- But all so soon as the all-cheering
- "sun\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw"
- "The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,"
- "Away from light steals home my heavy son,"
- "And private in his chamber pens himself,"
- "Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out"
- And makes himself an artificial night.
- "Black and portentous must this humour prove,"
- Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
- BENVOLIO.
- "My noble uncle, do you know the cause?"
- MONTAGUE.
- I neither know it nor can learn of him.
- BENVOLIO.
- Have you importun’d him by any means
- "?\n\nMONTAGUE."
- Both by myself and many other friends;
- "But he, his own affections’ counsellor"
- ","
- Is to himself—I will not say how true
- "—\nBut to himself so secret and so close,"
- "So far from sounding and discovery,"
- As is the bud bit with an envious
- worm
- Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the
- "air,"
- Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
- Could we but learn from whence his sorrows
- "grow,"
- We would as willingly give cure as know.
- "Enter Romeo.\n\nBENVOLIO."
- "See, where he comes."
- So please you step aside;
- I’ll know his grievance or be
- "much denied.\n\nMONTAGUE."
- I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
- To hear true shrift.
- "Come, madam, let’s away,"
- "[_Exeunt Montague and Lady"
- "Montague._]"
- BENVOLIO.
- "Good morrow, cousin."
- "ROMEO.\nIs the day so young?"
- BENVOLIO.
- "But new struck nine.\n\nROMEO."
- "Ay me, sad hours seem long."
- Was that my father that went hence so fast?
- "BENVOLIO.\nIt was."
- What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?
- ROMEO.
- "Not having that which, having, makes them short"
- ".\n\nBENVOLIO.\nIn love?"
- "ROMEO.\nOut."
- "BENVOLIO.\nOf love?"
- ROMEO.
- Out of her favour where I am in love.
- BENVOLIO.
- "Alas that love so gentle in his view,"
- Should be so tyrannous and rough in
- "proof.\n\nROMEO."
- "Alas that love, whose view is muffled still"
- ","
- "Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will"
- "!\nWhere shall we dine? O me!"
- What fray was here?
- "Yet tell me not, for I have heard it"
- all.
- "Here’s much to do with hate, but"
- "more with love:"
- "Why, then, O brawling love!"
- O loving hate!
- "O anything, of nothing first create!"
- O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
- Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
- "Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire"
- ", sick health!"
- "Still-waking sleep, that is not what it"
- is!
- "This love feel I, that feel no love in"
- "this.\nDost thou not laugh?"
- BENVOLIO.
- "No coz, I rather weep."
- "ROMEO.\nGood heart, at what?"
- BENVOLIO.
- At thy good heart’s oppression.
- ROMEO.
- Why such is love’s transgression.
- Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my
- "breast,"
- Which thou wilt propagate to have it
- "prest\nWith more of thine."
- This love that thou hast shown
- Doth add more grief to too much of mine
- own.
- Love is a smoke made with the fume of
- sighs;
- "Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in"
- lovers’ eyes;
- "Being vex’d, a sea"
- "nourish’d with lovers’ tears:"
- What is it else?
- "A madness most discreet,"
- "A choking gall, and a preserving sweet."
- "Farewell, my coz."
- "[_Going._]"
- BENVOLIO.
- "Soft! I will go along:"
- "And if you leave me so, you do me"
- "wrong.\n\nROMEO.\nTut!"
- I have lost myself; I am not here.
- "This is not Romeo, he’s some other"
- "where.\n\nBENVOLIO."
- Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
- ROMEO.
- "What, shall I groan and tell thee?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGroan!"
- "Why, no; but sadly tell me who."
- ROMEO.
- Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
- ","
- A word ill urg’d to one that
- is so ill.
- "In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman"
- ".\n\nBENVOLIO."
- I aim’d so near when I
- suppos’d you lov’d
- ".\n\nROMEO."
- "A right good markman, and she’s"
- "fair I love.\n\nBENVOLIO."
- "A right fair mark, fair coz, is"
- "soonest hit.\n\nROMEO."
- "Well, in that hit you miss:"
- she’ll not be hit
- "With Cupid’s arrow, she hath"
- Dian’s wit;
- And in strong proof of chastity well
- "arm’d,"
- From love’s weak childish bow she lives
- uncharm’d.
- She will not stay the siege of loving terms
- Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes
- ","
- Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing
- "gold:"
- "O she’s rich in beauty, only poor"
- "That when she dies, with beauty dies her store"
- ".\n\nBENVOLIO."
- Then she hath sworn that she will still live
- "chaste?\n\nROMEO."
- "She hath, and in that sparing makes"
- huge waste;
- "For beauty starv’d with her severity,"
- Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
- "She is too fair, too wise; wisely"
- "too fair,"
- To merit bliss by making me despair.
- "She hath forsworn to love,"
- and in that vow
- "Do I live dead, that live to tell it"
- "now.\n\nBENVOLIO."
- "Be rul’d by me, forget to"
- "think of her.\n\nROMEO."
- O teach me how I should forget to think.
- BENVOLIO.
- By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
- Examine other beauties.
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis the way"
- "To call hers, exquisite, in question more."
- "These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,"
- "Being black, puts us in mind they hide the"
- "fair;\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget"
- The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
- "Show me a mistress that is passing fair,"
- What doth her beauty serve but as a note
- Where I may read who pass’d that passing
- fair?
- "Farewell, thou canst not teach me"
- "to forget.\n\nBENVOLIO."
- "I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die"
- in debt.
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- SCENE II. A Street.
- "Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant."
- CAPULET.
- "But Montague is bound as well as I,"
- In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard
- ", I think,"
- For men so old as we to keep the peace
- ".\n\nPARIS."
- "Of honourable reckoning are you both,"
- And pity ’tis you liv’d
- at odds so long.
- "But now my lord, what say you to my"
- "suit?\n\nCAPULET."
- But saying o’er what I have said before
- "."
- "My child is yet a stranger in the world,"
- She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
- ";\nLet two more summers wither in their pride"
- Ere we may think her ripe to be a
- "bride.\n\nPARIS."
- Younger than she are happy mothers made.
- CAPULET.
- And too soon marr’d are those so
- early made.
- The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she
- ",\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:"
- "But woo her, gentle Paris, get her"
- "heart,"
- My will to her consent is but a part;
- "And she agree, within her scope of choice"
- Lies my consent and fair according voice.
- This night I hold an old
- "accustom’d feast,"
- "Whereto I have invited many a guest,"
- "Such as I love, and you among the store"
- ","
- "One more, most welcome, makes my number more"
- "."
- At my poor house look to behold this night
- Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven
- "light:"
- Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
- When well apparell’d April on the
- heel
- "Of limping winter treads, even such"
- "delight\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night"
- Inherit at my house.
- "Hear all, all see,"
- "And like her most whose merit most shall be:"
- "Which, on more view of many, mine,"
- "being one,"
- "May stand in number, though in reckoning"
- "none.\nCome, go with me."
- "Go, sirrah, trudge about"
- Through fair Verona; find those persons out
- "Whose names are written there, [_gives"
- "a paper_] and to them say,"
- My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
- "[_Exeunt Capulet and Paris."
- "_]\n\nSERVANT."
- Find them out whose names are written here!
- It is written that the
- shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the
- "tailor with his last, the"
- "fisher with his pencil, and the painter with"
- his nets; but I am sent to
- "find those persons whose names are here writ,"
- and can never find what
- names the writing person hath here writ.
- "I must to the learned. In good\ntime!"
- Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
- BENVOLIO.
- "Tut, man, one fire burns out"
- "another’s burning,"
- One pain is lessen’d by
- another’s anguish;
- "Turn giddy, and be holp"
- by backward turning;
- One desperate grief cures with another’s
- "languish:"
- "Take thou some new infection to thy eye,"
- And the rank poison of the old will die.
- ROMEO.
- Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
- BENVOLIO.
- "For what, I pray thee?"
- "ROMEO.\nFor your broken shin."
- BENVOLIO.
- "Why, Romeo, art thou mad?"
- ROMEO.
- "Not mad, but bound more than a madman"
- "is:"
- "Shut up in prison, kept without my food,"
- Whipp’d and tormented and—
- "God-den, good fellow."
- SERVANT.
- God gi’ go-den.
- "I pray, sir, can you read?"
- ROMEO.
- "Ay, mine own fortune in my misery."
- SERVANT.
- Perhaps you have learned it without book.
- "But I pray, can you read anything you see"
- "?\n\nROMEO."
- "Ay, If I know the letters and the"
- "language.\n\nSERVANT."
- "Ye say honestly, rest you merry!"
- ROMEO.
- "Stay, fellow; I can read."
- "[_He reads the letter._]"
- _Signior Martino and his wife and daughters
- ;
- County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters

- Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces
- ";\nMercutio and his brother Valentine;"
- "Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters"
- ";\nMy fair niece Rosaline and Livia;"
- Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt
- ";\nLucio and the lively Helena. _"
- A fair assembly.
- "[_Gives back the paper_]"
- Whither should they come?
- "SERVANT.\nUp."
- "ROMEO.\nWhither to supper?"
- "SERVANT.\nTo our house."
- "ROMEO.\nWhose house?"
- "SERVANT.\nMy master’s."
- ROMEO.
- Indeed I should have ask’d you that before
- ".\n\nSERVANT."
- Now I’ll tell you without asking.
- "My master is the great rich Capulet,"
- and if you be not of the house of
- "Montagues, I pray come and crush a"
- cup of wine. Rest you merry.
- "[_Exit._]"
- BENVOLIO.
- At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s
- Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so
- lov’st;
- With all the admired beauties of Verona.
- Go thither and with unattainted
- "eye,"
- Compare her face with some that I shall
- "show,"
- And I will make thee think thy swan a
- "crow.\n\nROMEO."
- When the devout religion of mine eye
- "Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to"
- fire;
- "And these who, often drown’d, could"
- "never die,"
- "Transparent heretics, be burnt for"
- "liars.\nOne fairer than my love?"
- The all-seeing sun
- Ne’er saw her match since first the
- "world begun.\n\nBENVOLIO."
- "Tut, you saw her fair, none else"
- "being by,"
- Herself pois’d with herself in either
- "eye:\nBut in that crystal scales let there be"
- weigh’d
- Your lady’s love against some other maid
- "That I will show you shining at this feast,"
- And she shall scant show well that now shows
- "best.\n\nROMEO."
- "I’ll go along, no such sight to"
- "be shown,"
- But to rejoice in splendour
- of my own.
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- SCENE III.
- Room in Capulet’s House.
- Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.
- LADY CAPULET.
- "Nurse, where’s my daughter?"
- "Call her forth to me.\n\nNURSE."
- "Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year"
- "old,\nI bade her come."
- "What, lamb! What ladybird!"
- God forbid! Where’s this girl?
- "What, Juliet!\n\n Enter Juliet."
- JULIET.
- "How now, who calls?"
- "NURSE.\nYour mother."
- JULIET.
- "Madam, I am here."
- What is your will?
- LADY CAPULET.
- This is the matter.
- "Nurse, give leave awhile,"
- We must talk in secret.
- "Nurse, come back again,"
- "I have remember’d me, thou’s"
- hear our counsel.
- Thou knowest my daughter’s of a

- "a lies asleep,"

- MERCUTIO.
- "True, I talk of dreams,"
- "Which are the children of an idle brain,"
- "Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,"
- "Which is as thin of substance as the air,"
- "And more inconstant than the wind, who"

- Within the infant rind of this weak flower
- "Poison hath residence, and medicine power:"

- "let me tell ye, if ye should lead her"
- "in a fool’s paradise, as they"
- "say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour"
- ", as they say; for the"

- "And therefore, if you should deal double with"
- "her, truly it were an ill thing to be"
- "offered to any gentlewoman, and"
- "very weak dealing.\n\nROMEO."
- "Nurse, commend me to thy lady and"

- NURSE.
- "Good heart, and i’faith I will tell"
- "her as much. Lord, Lord, she will"
- "be a joyful woman.\n\nROMEO."
- "What wilt thou tell her, Nurse?"
- Thou dost not mark me.
- NURSE.
- "I will tell her, sir, that you do"
- "protest, which, as I take it, is"
- "a\ngentlemanlike offer.\n\nROMEO."
- Bid her devise
- Some means to come to shrift this afternoon

- And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell
- Be shriv’d and married.
- "Here is for thy pains.\n\nNURSE."
- "No truly, sir; not a penny."
- ROMEO.
- Go to; I say you shall.
- "NURSE.\nThis afternoon, sir?"
- "Well, she shall be there."
- ROMEO.
- "And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall"
- "."
- "Within this hour my man shall be with thee,"
- And bring thee cords made like a tackled
- "stair,"
- Which to the high topgallant of my joy
- Must be my convoy in the secret night.
- "Farewell, be trusty, and"
- I’ll quit thy pains;
- Farewell; commend me to thy
- "mistress.\n\nNURSE."
- Now God in heaven bless thee.
- "Hark you, sir.\n\nROMEO."
- "What say’st thou, my dear Nurse"
- "?\n\nNURSE.\nIs your man secret?"
- "Did you ne’er hear say,"
- "Two may keep counsel, putting one away?"
- ROMEO.
- I warrant thee my man’s as true as
- "steel.\n\nNURSE."
- "Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest"
- "lady. Lord, Lord!"
- When ’twas a
- "little prating thing,—O, there is"
- "a nobleman in town, one Paris, that"
- "would fain lay knife aboard; but she,"
- "good soul, had as lief see a"
- "toad, a very toad, as see"
- him.
- "I anger her sometimes, and tell her that"
- "Paris is the properer man, but"
- "I’ll warrant you, when I say so"
- ", she"
- looks as pale as any clout in the
- versal world.
- Doth not rosemary and
- Romeo begin both with a letter?
- ROMEO.
- "Ay, Nurse; what of that?"
- "Both with an R.\n\nNURSE."
- "Ah, mocker!"
- That’s the dog’s name.
- "R is for the—no, I know it"
- begins
- "with some other letter, and she hath the"
- "prettiest sententious of it,"
- "of you and rosemary, that it would"
- do you good to hear it.
- ROMEO.
- Commend me to thy lady.

- SCENE V.
- "Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Juliet."
- JULIET.
- The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse
- ",\nIn half an hour she promised to return."
- Perchance she cannot meet him.
- That’s not so.
- "O, she is lame."
- "Love’s heralds should be thoughts,"
- Which ten times faster glides than the
- "sun’s beams,"
- "Driving back shadows over lowering hills:"
- Therefore do nimble-pinion’d
- "doves draw love,"
- And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid
- wings.
- Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
- "Of this day’s journey, and from nine"
- till twelve
- "Is three long hours, yet she is not come"
- ".\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,"
- She’d be as swift in motion as a
- ball;
- My words would bandy her to my sweet love
- ",\nAnd his to me."
- "But old folks, many feign as they"
- were dead;
- "Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale"
- "as lead.\n\n Enter Nurse and Peter."
- "O God, she comes."
- "O honey Nurse, what news?"
- Hast thou met with him?
- "Send thy man away.\n\nNURSE."
- "Peter, stay at the gate."
- "[_Exit Peter._]"
- JULIET.
- "Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord,"
- why look’st thou sad?
- "Though news be sad, yet tell them"
- merrily;
- "If good, thou sham’st the"
- music of sweet news
- By playing it to me with so sour a face
- ".\n\nNURSE."
- "I am aweary, give me leave awhile;"
- "Fie, how my bones ache!"
- What a jaunt have I had!
- JULIET.
- "I would thou hadst my bones, and I"
- "thy news:"
- "Nay come, I pray thee speak; good"
- ", good Nurse, speak.\n\nNURSE."
- "Jesu, what haste?"
- Can you not stay a while?
- Do you not see that I am
- "out of breath?\n\nJULIET."
- "How art thou out of breath, when thou"
- hast breath
- To say to me that thou art out of breath
- "?"
- The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
- Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
- Is thy news good or bad?
- Answer to that;
- "Say either, and I’ll stay the"
- circumstance.
- "Let me be satisfied, is’t good or"
- "bad?\n\nNURSE."
- "Well, you have made a simple choice; you"
- know not how to choose a man.
- "Romeo? No, not he."
- Though his face be better than any man’s
- ", yet his"
- "leg excels all men’s, and"
- "for a hand and a foot, and a body"
- ", though"
- "they be not to be talked on, yet they"
- are past compare. He is not the
- "flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him"
- as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
- "ways, wench, serve God."
- "What, have you dined at home?"
- "JULIET.\nNo, no."
- But all this did I know before.
- What says he of our marriage?
- "What of that?\n\nNURSE."
- "Lord, how my head aches!"
- What a head have I!
- It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
- "My back o’ t’other side,—"
- "O my back, my back!"
- Beshrew your heart for sending me about
- To catch my death with jauncing up and
- "down.\n\nJULIET."
- "I’faith, I am sorry that thou art"
- not well.
- "Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me,"
- "what says my love?\n\nNURSE."
- "Your love says like an honest gentleman,"
- "And a courteous, and a kind, and"
- "a handsome,"
- "And I warrant a virtuous,—Where"
- "is your mother?\n\nJULIET."
- Where is my mother?
- "Why, she is within."
- Where should she be?
- How oddly thou repliest.
- "‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,"
- ‘Where is your mother?’
- NURSE.
- "O God’s lady dear,"
- Are you so hot?
- "Marry, come up, I trow."
- Is this the poultice for my aching
- bones?
- Henceforward do your messages yourself.
- JULIET.
- Here’s such a coil.
- "Come, what says Romeo?\n\nNURSE."
- Have you got leave to go to shrift
- today?
- "JULIET.\nI have."
- NURSE.
- Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’
- cell;
- There stays a husband to make you a wife.
- Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
- ","
- They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news
- ".\nHie you to church."
- "I must another way,"
- To fetch a ladder by the which your love
- Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it
- is dark.
- "I am the drudge, and toil in"
- your delight;
- But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
- Go.
- I’ll to dinner; hie you to
- "the cell.\n\nJULIET."
- Hie to high fortune!
- "Honest Nurse, farewell."
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- SCENE VI.
- Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
- Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- So smile the heavens upon this holy act
- That after-hours with sorrow chide us not
- ".\n\nROMEO."
- "Amen, amen, but come what sorrow"
- "can,"
- It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
- That one short minute gives me in her sight.
- "Do thou but close our hands with holy words,"
- Then love-devouring death do what he
- "dare,"
- It is enough I may but call her mine.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "These violent delights have violent ends,"
- And in their triumph die; like fire and powder
- ","
- Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
- "Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,"
- And in the taste confounds the appetite.
- "Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;"
- Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
- "Enter Juliet.\n\nHere comes the lady."
- "O, so light a foot"
- Will ne’er wear out the everlasting
- flint.
- A lover may bestride the gossamers
- That idles in the wanton summer air
- And yet not fall; so light is vanity
- ".\n\nJULIET."
- Good even to my ghostly confessor.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both"
- ".\n\nJULIET."
- "As much to him, else is his thanks too"
- "much.\n\nROMEO."
- "Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy"
- "Be heap’d like mine, and that thy"
- skill be more
- "To blazon it, then sweeten with"
- thy breath
- "This neighbour air, and let rich music’s"
- tongue
- Unfold the imagin’d happiness that
- "both\nReceive in either by this dear encounter."
- JULIET.
- Conceit more rich in matter than in words
- ",\nBrags of his substance, not of"
- ornament.
- They are but beggars that can count their
- worth;
- "But my true love is grown to such excess,"
- I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "Come, come with me, and we will make"
- "short work,"
- "For, by your leaves, you shall not stay"
- "alone\nTill holy church incorporate two in one."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT III"
- SCENE I. A public Place.
- "Enter Mercutio, Benvolio"
- ", Page and Servants."
- BENVOLIO.
- "I pray thee, good Mercutio,"
- "let’s retire:"
- "The day is hot, the Capulets abroad"
- ","
- "And if we meet, we shall not scape"
- "a brawl,"
- "For now these hot days, is the mad blood"
- "stirring.\n\nMERCUTIO."
- "Thou art like one of these fellows that,"
- when he enters the confines of
- "a tavern, claps me his sword upon"
- "the table, and says ‘God send me no"
- need of thee!’
- and by the operation of the second cup draws him
- on the
- "drawer, when indeed there is no need."
- BENVOLIO.
- Am I like such a fellow?
- MERCUTIO.
- "Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack"
- in thy mood as any in Italy; and as
- "soon moved to be moody, and as soon"
- moody to be moved.
- "BENVOLIO.\nAnd what to?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "Nay, an there were two such, we"
- "should have none shortly, for one would"
- kill the other. Thou?
- "Why, thou wilt quarrel with a"
- man that hath a
- hair more or a hair less in his beard than
- thou hast.
- Thou wilt quarrel
- "with a man for cracking nuts, having no other"
- "reason but because thou\nhast hazel eyes."
- What eye but such an eye would spy out such
- a quarrel?
- Thy head is as full of
- quarrels as an egg is full of
- "meat, and yet thy"
- head hath been beaten as addle as an
- egg for quarrelling.
- Thou hast
- quarrelled with a man for coughing in
- "the street, because he hath"
- wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep
- in the sun. Didst thou not fall
- out with a tailor for wearing his new
- doublet before Easter? with
- another for tying his new shoes with an old
- riband? And yet thou wilt
- tutor me from quarrelling!
- BENVOLIO.
- And I were so apt to quarrel
- "as thou art, any man should buy the fee"
- simple of my life for an hour and a quarter
- ".\n\nMERCUTIO."
- The fee simple! O simple!
- Enter Tybalt and others.
- BENVOLIO.
- "By my head, here comes the Capulets"
- ".\n\nMERCUTIO."
- "By my heel, I care not."
- TYBALT.
- "Follow me close, for I will speak to them"
- "."
- "Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one"
- "of you.\n\nMERCUTIO."
- And but one word with one of us?
- Couple it with something; make it a
- "word and a blow.\n\nTYBALT."
- "You shall find me apt enough to that,"
- "sir, and you will give me\noccasion."
- MERCUTIO.
- Could you not take some occasion without giving?
- TYBALT.
- "Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo"
- ".\n\nMERCUTIO."
- "Consort? What, dost thou make us"
- minstrels?
- And thou make minstrels of
- "us, look to hear nothing but discords."
- "Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s"
- that shall make you dance.
- "Zounds, consort!"
- BENVOLIO.
- We talk here in the public haunt of men
- ".\nEither withdraw unto some private place,"
- "And reason coldly of your grievances,"
- Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us
- ".\n\nMERCUTIO."
- "Men’s eyes were made to look, and"

- I will not budge for no man’s
- "pleasure, I.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- TYBALT.
- "Well, peace be with you, sir, here"
- "comes my man.\n\nMERCUTIO."
- "But I’ll be hanged, sir, if"
- he wear your livery.
- "Marry, go before to field,"
- he’ll be your follower;
- Your worship in that sense may call him man.
- TYBALT.
- "Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford"
- "No better term than this: Thou art a"
- "villain.\n\nROMEO."
- "Tybalt, the reason that I have to love"
- thee
- Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
- To such a greeting.
- Villain am I none;
- Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st
- "me not.\n\nTYBALT."
- "Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries"
- "That thou hast done me, therefore turn and"
- "draw.\n\nROMEO."
- I do protest I never injur’d
- "thee,"
- But love thee better than thou canst devise
- Till thou shalt know the reason of my love

- "And so good Capulet, which name I tender"
- "As dearly as mine own, be satisfied."

- "Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you"
- "walk?\n\nTYBALT."
- What wouldst thou have with me?
- MERCUTIO.
- "Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your"
- nine lives; that I mean to
- "make bold withal, and, as you shall"
- "use me hereafter, dry-beat the"
- "rest\nof the eight."
- Will you pluck your sword out of his

- "What, art thou hurt?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "Ay, ay, a scratch, a"
- "scratch. Marry, ’tis enough."
- Where is my page?
- "Go villain, fetch a surgeon."
- "[_Exit Page._]"
- ROMEO.
- "Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much."
- MERCUTIO.
- "No, ’tis not so deep as a"
- "well, nor so wide as a church door,"
- but ’tis
- "enough, ’twill serve."
- "Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me"
- "a\ngrave man."
- "I am peppered, I warrant, for this"

- "Ha, banishment?"

- Do not say banishment.

- Hence from Verona art thou banished.
- "Be patient, for the world is broad and wide"
- ".\n\nROMEO."
- "There is no world without Verona walls,"
- "But purgatory, torture, hell itself."
- Hence banished is banish’d from the world

- And world’s exile is death. Then banished

- Heaven is here
- "Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,"
- "And little mouse, every unworthy thing,"
- "Live here in heaven and may look on her,"

- I’ll give thee armour to keep off that

- Where is she? And how doth she?
- "And what says\nMy conceal’d lady to our"

- My father Capulet will have it so;

- You say you do not know the lady’s

- Uneven is the course; I like it
- "not.\n\nPARIS."
- Immoderately she weeps for
- "Tybalt’s death,"
- And therefore have I little talk’d of love

- For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
- "Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous"
- That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
- "And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,"
- "To stop the inundation of her tears,"
- "Which, too much minded by herself alone,"
- May be put from her by society.
- Now do you know the reason of this haste

- Come you to make confession to this father?
- JULIET.
- "To answer that, I should confess to you."
- PARIS.
- Do not deny to him that you love me.
- JULIET.
- I will confess to you that I love him.
- PARIS.
- "So will ye, I am sure, that you"
- "love me.\n\nJULIET."
- "If I do so, it will be of more"
- "price,"
- Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
- PARIS.
- "Poor soul, thy face is much"

- JULIET.
- The tears have got small victory by that;
- For it was bad enough before their spite.
- PARIS.
- Thou wrong’st it more than tears
- "with that report.\n\nJULIET."
- "That is no slander, sir, which is"
- "a truth,"
- "And what I spake, I spake it"

- As that is desperate which we would prevent.
- "If, rather than to marry County Paris"
- Thou hast the strength of will to
- "slay thyself,"
- Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
- A thing like death to chide away this shame
- ",\nThat cop’st with death himself to"

- "Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run"
- With open outcry toward our monument.
- PRINCE.
- What fear is this which startles in our ears
- "?\n\nFIRST WATCH."
- "Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,"
- "And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,"
- Warm and new kill’d.
- PRINCE.
- "Search, seek, and know how this foul murder"
- "comes.\n\nFIRST WATCH."
- "Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d"
- "Romeo’s man,"
- With instruments upon them fit to open
- These dead men’s tombs.
- "CAPULET.\nO heaven!"
- "O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!"
- "This dagger hath mista’en, for"
- "lo, his house"
- "Is empty on the back of Montague,"
- And it mis-sheathed in my
- daughter’s bosom.
- LADY CAPULET.
- O me!
- This sight of death is as a bell
- That warns my old age to a
- sepulchre.
- Enter Montague and others.
- PRINCE.
- "Come, Montague, for thou art early up"
- ","
- To see thy son and heir more early down.
- MONTAGUE.
- "Alas, my liege, my wife is"
- dead tonight.
- Grief of my son’s exile hath
- stopp’d her breath.
- What further woe conspires against mine age
- "?\n\nPRINCE."
- "Look, and thou shalt see."
- MONTAGUE.
- O thou untaught!
- "What manners is in this,"
- To press before thy father to a grave?
- PRINCE.
- "Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,"
- "Till we can clear these ambiguities,"
- "And know their spring, their head, their true"
- "descent,"
- And then will I be general of your woes
- ",\nAnd lead you even to death."
- "Meantime forbear,"
- And let mischance be slave to patience.
- Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "I am the greatest, able to do least,"
- "Yet most suspected, as the time and place"
- "Doth make against me, of this direful"
- murder.
- "And here I stand, both to impeach and"
- purge
- Myself condemned and myself excus’d.
- PRINCE.
- Then say at once what thou dost know in
- "this.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE."
- "I will be brief, for my short date of"
- breath
- Is not so long as is a tedious tale
- "."
- "Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet"
- ","
- "And she, there dead, that Romeo’s"
- "faithful wife.\nI married them; and their"
- stol’n marriage day
- "Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose"
- untimely death
- Banish’d the new-made
- bridegroom from this city;
- "For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet"
- pin’d.
- "You, to remove that siege of grief from her"
- ","
- "Betroth’d, and would have married her"
- perforce
- "To County Paris. Then comes she to me,"
- "And with wild looks, bid me devise some"
- "means\nTo rid her from this second marriage,"
- Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
- "Then gave I her, so tutored by my"
- "art,"
- "A sleeping potion, which so took effect"
- "As I intended, for it wrought on her"
- The form of death.
- Meantime I writ to Romeo
- That he should hither come as this dire night
- To help to take her from her borrow’d
- "grave,"
- Being the time the potion’s force should
- cease.
- "But he which bore my letter, Friar John"
- ",\nWas stay’d by accident; and"
- yesternight
- Return’d my letter back. Then all alone
- At the prefixed hour of her waking
- Came I to take her from her
- "kindred’s vault,"
- Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
- Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
- "But when I came, some minute ere the"
- time
- "Of her awaking, here untimely"
- "lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead."
- She wakes; and I entreated her come
- "forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience."
- But then a noise did scare me from the tomb
- ;
- "And she, too desperate, would not go with"
- "me,"
- "But, as it seems, did violence on herself"
- ".\nAll this I know; and to the marriage"
- Her Nurse is privy.
- And if ought in this
- "Miscarried by my fault, let my old"
- life
- "Be sacrific’d, some hour"
- "before his time,"
- Unto the rigour of severest law.
- PRINCE.
- We still have known thee for a holy man.
- Where’s Romeo’s man?
- What can he say to this?
- BALTHASAR.
- I brought my master news of Juliet’s death
- ","
- And then in post he came from Mantua
- "To this same place, to this same monument."
- "This letter he early bid me give his father,"
- "And threaten’d me with death, going in"
- "the vault,"
- "If I departed not, and left him there."
- PRINCE.
- "Give me the letter, I will look on it"
- ".\nWhere is the County’s Page that"
- rais’d the watch?
- "Sirrah, what made your master in this place"
- "?\n\nPAGE."
- He came with flowers to strew his
- "lady’s grave,"
- "And bid me stand aloof, and so I"
- did.
- Anon comes one with light to ope the
- "tomb,"
- "And by and by my master drew on him,"
- And then I ran away to call the watch.
- PRINCE.
- This letter doth make good the
- "Friar’s words,"
- "Their course of love, the tidings of"
- her death.
- And here he writes that he did buy a poison
- "Of a poor ’pothecary, and"
- therewithal
- "Came to this vault to die, and lie with"
- "Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies?"
- "Capulet, Montague,"
- See what a scourge is laid upon your
- "hate,"
- That heaven finds means to kill your joys with
- love!
- "And I, for winking at your discords"
- "too,"
- Have lost a brace of kinsmen.
- All are punish’d.
- CAPULET.
- "O brother Montague, give me thy hand."
- "This is my daughter’s jointure, for"
- "no more\nCan I demand."
- MONTAGUE.
- "But I can give thee more,"
- "For I will raise her statue in pure gold,"
- "That whiles Verona by that name is known,"
- There shall no figure at such rate be set
- As that of true and faithful Juliet.
- CAPULET.
- As rich shall Romeo’s by his
- "lady’s lie,"
- Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
- PRINCE.
- A glooming peace this morning with it brings
- ;
- The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
- "Go hence, to have more talk of these sad"
- things.
- "Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished"
- ",\nFor never was a story of more woe"
- Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
