- So Miss Lavish
- Lavish proceeded
- through the
- the streets of

- a blue military

- “No—in the

- About five miles

- Miss Lavish
- Lavish seemed
- "interested, and"

- her trot.
- “What a

- “Very well

- “And old Mrs.

- "“Why, she rents"
- rents a field of

- How funny!”
- Miss Lavish
- Lavish looked at
- at the narrow
- narrow ribbon of
- "of sky, and"

- ": “Oh, you have"

- "“Hardly any,”"
- "any,” said Lucy,"
- "Lucy, fearful of"

- “Only thirty
- thirty acres—
- acres—just the

- Miss Lavish was
- was not
- "not disgusted,"
- ", and said it"
- said it was just
- was just the
- just the size of
- size of her
- of her aunt’s
- aunt’s Suffolk
- Suffolk estate.
- Italy receded.
- They tried to
- to remember the
- the last name of
- name of Lady
- of Lady Louisa
- "Louisa someone,"
- "someone, who had"
- who had taken a
- taken a house
- a house near
- near Summer
- Summer Street
- Street the other
- "other year, but"
- ", but she had"
- she had not
- had not liked it
- "liked it, which"
- ", which was odd"
- was odd of her.
- And just as Miss
- as Miss Lavish
- Lavish had got
- had got the name
- "the name, she"
- ", she broke off"
- off and
- "and exclaimed:"
- “Bless us!
- Bless us and
- us and save us!
- We’ve lost the
- lost the way.”
- Certainly they
- they had seemed
- seemed a long
- a long time in
- time in reaching
- reaching Santa
- "Santa Croce, the"
- ", the tower of"
- tower of which
- of which had
- had been plainly
- plainly visible
- visible from the
- from the landing
- landing window.
- But Miss Lavish
- Lavish had said
- had said so much
- so much about
- about knowing
- knowing her
- her Florence by
- "by heart, that"
- ", that Lucy had"
- had followed her
- her with no
- no misgivings.
- “Lost! lost!
- My dear Miss
- "Miss Lucy,"
- "Lucy, during our"
- our political
- diatribes we
- we have taken a
- taken a wrong
- a wrong turning.
- How those horrid
- Conservatives
- would jeer at us
- at us!
- What are we to
- we to do?
- Two lone females
- females in an
- in an unknown
- unknown town.
- "Now, this is"
- this is what _I_
- what _I_ call an
- an adventure.”
- "Lucy, who wanted"
- wanted to see
- to see Santa
- "Santa Croce,"
- "Croce, suggested"
- ", as a possible"
- "solution,"
- that they should
- should ask the
- ask the way
- the way there.
- "“Oh, but that is"
- that is the word
- the word of a

- "And no, you are"
- "you are not, not"
- "not, not, _not_"

- Baedeker.
- Give it to me; I
- to me; I shan’t
- I shan’t let you
- let you carry it
- carry it.
- We will simply

- Accordingly they
- they drifted
- drifted through
- through a series
- a series of
- of those grey-
- grey-brown
- "-brown streets,"
- neither
- commodious nor
- "nor picturesque,"
- ", in which the"
- the eastern
- eastern quarter
- quarter of the
- of the city
- the city abounds
- abounds.
- Lucy soon lost
- lost interest in
- in the
- the discontent
- "of Lady Louisa,"
- and became
- discontented
- herself.
- For one
- one ravishing
- moment Italy
- Italy appeared.
- She stood in the
- in the Square of
- of the
- the Annunziata
- and saw in the
- in the living
- living terra-
- terra-cotta
- "-cotta those"
- those divine
- divine babies
- babies whom no
- whom no cheap

- can ever stale.
- There they stood
- "stood, with"

- their shining
- shining limbs
- limbs bursting
- bursting from
- from the
- the garments of
- "of charity, and"
- ", and their"
- their strong
- strong white
- white arms
- arms extended
- extended against
- against circlets
- circlets of
- of heaven.
- Lucy thought she
- she had never
- never seen
- seen anything
- anything more
- more beautiful;
- ; but Miss
- "but Miss Lavish,"
- "Lavish, with a"
- ", with a shriek"
- a shriek of
- "of dismay,"
- "dismay, dragged"
- dragged her
- "her forward,"
- ", declaring that"
- that they were
- were out of
- out of their

- The hour was
- was approaching
- at which the
- the continental
- breakfast begins
- "begins, or"
- ", or rather"
- "rather ceases,"
- "ceases, to tell,"
- "to tell, and the"
- and the ladies
- ladies bought
- bought some hot
- hot chestnut
- chestnut paste
- paste out of a
- out of a little
- "a little shop,"
- "shop, because it"
- it looked so
- so typical.
- It tasted partly
- partly of the

- in which it was
- "it was wrapped,"
- "wrapped, partly"
- ", partly of hair"
- "of hair oil,"
- "oil, partly of"
- of the great

- But it gave them
- them strength to
- to drift into
- into another
- "another Piazza,"
- "large and dusty,"
- "dusty, on the"
- ", on the farther"
- farther side of
- side of which
- of which rose a
- rose a black-and
- "-and-white"
- "-white façade of"
- of surpassing
- ugliness.
- Miss Lavish
- Lavish spoke to
- spoke to it
- it dramatically.
- It was Santa
- Santa Croce.
- The adventure
- was over.
- “Stop a minute;
- minute; let
- ; let those two
- two people go on
- "go on, or I"
- "on, or I shall"
- I shall have to
- have to speak to

- I do detest

- Nasty!
- they are going
- going into the
- "into the church,"
- "church, too."
- "Oh, the"

- abroad!”
- “We sat opposite
- opposite them at

- They have given

- They were so
- were so very
- so very kind.”
- “Look at their
- at their figures
- figures!”
- laughed Miss
- Miss Lavish.
- “They walk
- walk through my
- my Italy like a
- like a pair of
- pair of cows.
- It’s very
- very naughty of
- "of me, but I"

- I would like to
- like to set an

- "Dover, and turn"
- and turn back
- back every

- pass it.”
- “What would you
- you ask us?”
- Miss Lavish laid
- laid her hand
- hand pleasantly
- "on Lucy’s arm,"
- "arm, as if to"
- as if to suggest
- suggest that she
- "that she, at all"
- ", at all events,"
- "events, would"
- ", would get full"
- get full marks.
- In this exalted
- exalted mood
- mood they
- they reached the
- the steps of the
- of the great
- "great church,"
- "church, and were"
- and were about
- about to enter
- to enter it when
- it when Miss
- Miss Lavish
- "Lavish stopped,"

- ", flung up her"
- "up her arms, and"
- ", and cried:"
- “There goes my

- I must have a

- And in a moment
- a moment she was
- she was away

- Lucy waited for
- for nearly ten

- Then she began
- began to get
- to get tired.
- The beggars
- beggars worried
- "worried her, the"
- "her, the dust"
- the dust blew in
- blew in her eyes
- "her eyes, and"

- She descended
- slowly into the
- into the Piazza
- Piazza with the
- the intention of
- of rejoining
- "Miss Lavish, who"

- really almost
- almost too
- too original.
- But at that
- at that moment

- "“Here’s a mess:"

- “I’m not sure

- Lucy.
- In her chastened

- She was

- “I’m glad it’s

- Was this where
- where the idea

- “Thank you very

- "Now, this was"

- Mr.
- Emerson was an

- On the other

- The son nodded.
- With a look of

- Observe how

- "—now, unhappily,"

- by restoration—
- —is untroubled
- by the snares of

- The lecturer was
- "was a clergyman,"

- The river was a

- Since she could

- She could

- For a moment she

- “After your

- She marched
- cheerfully to
- to the fountain
- fountain and
- "and back, and"
- ", and did a few"
- few calculations
- in realism.
- Then she said
- she said that
- that she had

- A good deal of

- The two men had

- For the five-

- Miss Lavish gave

- “I confess that

- There was a

- Lavish had
- had concluded.
- Then the cousins

- At present her

- “She is

- Bartlett slowly.
- “None but the

- We had a long

- The last remark

- “I am about to

- The view thence

- —far better than

- It is the view

- Decidedly.
- But who looks at

- Miss Bartlett
- Bartlett had not

- she knew that Mr

- A few days ago

- But the joys of

- A drive in the

- Eager and Miss
- Miss Bartlett—
- —even if

- She echoed the

- Only when she
