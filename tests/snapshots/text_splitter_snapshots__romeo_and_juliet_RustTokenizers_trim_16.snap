- "CHORUS.\nTwo households, both alike in dignity,"
- "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,"
- "From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,"
- Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
- From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
- A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
- Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
- Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
- "The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,"
- "And the continuance of their parents’ rage,"
- "Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,"
- Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
- "The which, if you with patient ears attend,"
- "What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "ACT I\n\nSCENE I. A public place."
- Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.
- "SAMPSON.\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals."
- "GREGORY.\nNo, for then we should be colliers."
- SAMPSON.
- "I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw."
- GREGORY.
- "Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar."
- "SAMPSON.\nI strike quickly, being moved."
- "GREGORY.\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike."
- "SAMPSON.\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me."
- GREGORY.
- "To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore,"
- "if thou\nart moved, thou runn’st away."
- "SAMPSON.\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand."
- I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
- GREGORY.
- "That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall."
- SAMPSON.
- "True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to"
- "the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and"
- thrust his maids to the wall.
- "GREGORY.\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men."
- SAMPSON.
- "’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought"
- with the
- "men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads."
- "GREGORY.\nThe heads of the maids?"
- SAMPSON.
- "Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in"
- "what sense\nthou wilt."
- "GREGORY.\nThey must take it in sense that feel it."
- SAMPSON.
- "Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I"
- "am a\npretty piece of flesh."
- GREGORY.
- "’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst"
- "been poor John.\nDraw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues."
- Enter Abram and Balthasar.
- "SAMPSON.\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee."
- "GREGORY.\nHow? Turn thy back and run?\n\nSAMPSON.\nFear me not."
- "GREGORY.\nNo, marry; I fear thee!"
- "SAMPSON.\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin."
- GREGORY.
- "I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list"
- "."
- SAMPSON.
- "Nay, as they dare."
- "I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to"
- them if they bear it.
- "ABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
- "SAMPSON.\nI do bite my thumb, sir."
- "ABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
- "SAMPSON.\nIs the law of our side if I say ay?"
- "GREGORY.\nNo."
- SAMPSON.
- "No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I"
- "bite my thumb, sir.\n\nGREGORY.\nDo you quarrel, sir?"
- "ABRAM.\nQuarrel, sir? No, sir."
- SAMPSON.
- "But if you do, sir, I am for you."
- "I serve as good a man as you.\n\nABRAM.\nNo better."
- "SAMPSON.\nWell, sir.\n\n Enter Benvolio."
- GREGORY.
- Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.
- "SAMPSON.\nYes, better, sir.\n\nABRAM.\nYou lie."
- "SAMPSON.\nDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow."
- "[_They fight._]"
- BENVOLIO.
- "Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do."
- "[_Beats down their swords._]\n\n Enter Tybalt."
- "TYBALT.\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?"
- "Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death."
- "BENVOLIO.\nI do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,"
- Or manage it to part these men with me.
- "TYBALT.\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word"
- "As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:"
- "Have at thee, coward.\n\n [_They fight._]"
- Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!"
- Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
- "Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet."
- "CAPULET.\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!"
- LADY CAPULET.
- "A crutch, a crutch!"
- Why call you for a sword?
- "CAPULET.\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,"
- And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
- Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.
- "MONTAGUE.\nThou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go."
- "LADY MONTAGUE.\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe."
- "Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants."
- "PRINCE.\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,"
- "Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—"
- "Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,"
- That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
- "With purple fountains issuing from your veins,"
- "On pain of torture, from those bloody hands"
- Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground
- And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
- "Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,"
- "By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,"
- "Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,"
- "And made Verona’s ancient citizens\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,"
- "To wield old partisans, in hands as old,"
- "Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate."
- "If ever you disturb our streets again,"
- Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
- "For this time all the rest depart away:"
- "You, Capulet, shall go along with me,"
- "And Montague, come you this afternoon,"
- "To know our farther pleasure in this case,"
- "To old Free-town, our common judgement-place."
- "Once more, on pain of death, all men depart."
- "[_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,"
- "Citizens and Servants._]"
- "MONTAGUE.\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?"
- "Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nHere were the servants of your adversary"
- "And yours, close fighting ere I did approach."
- "I drew to part them, in the instant came"
- "The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,"
- "Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,"
- "He swung about his head, and cut the winds,"
- "Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn."
- While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
- "Came more and more, and fought on part and part,"
- "Till the Prince came, who parted either part."
- "LADY MONTAGUE.\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?"
- Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
- "BENVOLIO.\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun"
- "Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,"
- "A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,"
- Where underneath the grove of sycamore
- "That westward rooteth from this city side,"
- So early walking did I see your son.
- "Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,"
- And stole into the covert of the wood.
- "I, measuring his affections by my own,"
- "Which then most sought where most might not be found,"
- "Being one too many by my weary self,"
- "Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,"
- And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
- "MONTAGUE.\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,"
- "With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,"
- Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
- But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
- Should in the farthest east begin to draw
- "The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,"
- "Away from light steals home my heavy son,"
- "And private in his chamber pens himself,"
- "Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night."
- "Black and portentous must this humour prove,"
- Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
- "BENVOLIO.\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?"
- "MONTAGUE.\nI neither know it nor can learn of him."
- "BENVOLIO.\nHave you importun’d him by any means?"
- "MONTAGUE.\nBoth by myself and many other friends;"
- "But he, his own affections’ counsellor,"
- Is to himself—I will not say how true—
- "But to himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,"
- As is the bud bit with an envious worm
- "Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,"
- Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
- "Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,"
- "We would as willingly give cure as know.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "BENVOLIO.\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;"
- I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.
- "MONTAGUE.\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay"
- "To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,"
- "[_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGood morrow, cousin.\n\nROMEO.\nIs the day so young?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nBut new struck nine."
- "ROMEO.\nAy me, sad hours seem long."
- Was that my father that went hence so fast?
- "BENVOLIO.\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?"
- "ROMEO.\nNot having that which, having, makes them short."
- "BENVOLIO.\nIn love?\n\nROMEO.\nOut.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nOf love?"
- "ROMEO.\nOut of her favour where I am in love."
- "BENVOLIO.\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,"
- Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.
- "ROMEO.\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,"
- "Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!"
- Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
- "Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all."
- "Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:"
- "Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!"
- "O anything, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!"
- Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
- "Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!"
- "Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!"
- "This love feel I, that feel no love in this."
- "Dost thou not laugh?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nNo coz, I rather weep."
- "ROMEO.\nGood heart, at what?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAt thy good heart’s oppression."
- "ROMEO.\nWhy such is love’s transgression."
- "Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,"
- Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
- With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
- Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
- Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
- "Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;"
- "Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’"
- "tears:\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,"
- "A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz."
- "[_Going._]"
- "BENVOLIO.\nSoft! I will go along:"
- "And if you leave me so, you do me wrong."
- "ROMEO.\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here."
- "This is not Romeo, he’s some other where."
- "BENVOLIO.\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who."
- "ROMEO.\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,"
- A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.
- "In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman."
- BENVOLIO.
- I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you
- lov’d.
- "ROMEO.\nA right good markman, and she’s fair I love."
- "BENVOLIO.\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit."
- "ROMEO.\nWell, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit"
- "With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;"
- "And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,"
- From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
- She will not stay the siege of loving terms
- "Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,"
- "Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:"
- "O she’s rich in beauty, only poor"
- "That when she dies, with beauty dies her store."
- "BENVOLIO.\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?"
- "ROMEO.\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;"
- "For beauty starv’d with her severity,"
- Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
- "She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,"
- To merit bliss by making me despair.
- "She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow"
- "Do I live dead, that live to tell it now."
- "BENVOLIO.\nBe rul’d by me, forget to think of her."
- "ROMEO.\nO teach me how I should forget to think."
- "BENVOLIO.\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\nExamine other beauties."
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis the way\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more."
- "These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,"
- "Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;"
- He that is strucken blind cannot forget
- The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
- "Show me a mistress that is passing fair,"
- What doth her beauty serve but as a note
- Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?
- "Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget."
- "BENVOLIO.\nI’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Street."
- "Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant."
- "CAPULET.\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,"
- "In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,"
- For men so old as we to keep the peace.
- "PARIS.\nOf honourable reckoning are you both,"
- And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
- "But now my lord, what say you to my suit?"
- "CAPULET.\nBut saying o’er what I have said before."
- "My child is yet a stranger in the world,"
- She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
- Let two more summers wither in their pride
- Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
- "PARIS.\nYounger than she are happy mothers made."
- "CAPULET.\nAnd too soon marr’d are those so early made."
- "The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,"
- "She is the hopeful lady of my earth:"
- "But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,"
- My will to her consent is but a part;
- "And she agree, within her scope of choice"
- Lies my consent and fair according voice.
- "This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,"
- "Whereto I have invited many a guest,"
- "Such as I love, and you among the store,"
- "One more, most welcome, makes my number more."
- At my poor house look to behold this night
- "Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:"
- Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
- When well apparell’d April on the heel
- "Of limping winter treads, even such delight"
- Among fresh female buds shall you this night
- "Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,"
- "And like her most whose merit most shall be:"
- "Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,"
- "May stand in number, though in reckoning none."
- "Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about"
- Through fair Verona; find those persons out
- "Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them"
- "say,\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay."
- "[_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]"
- "SERVANT.\nFind them out whose names are written here! It is written that the"
- "shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the"
- "fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent"
- "to\nfind those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what"
- names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned.
- "In good\ntime!\n\n Enter Benvolio and Romeo."
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,"
- One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
- "Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;"
- "One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:"
- "Take thou some new infection to thy eye,"
- And the rank poison of the old will die.
- "ROMEO.\nYour plantain leaf is excellent for that."
- "BENVOLIO.\nFor what, I pray thee?\n\nROMEO.\nFor your broken shin."
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?"
- "ROMEO.\nNot mad, but bound more than a madman is:"
- "Shut up in prison, kept without my food,"
- "Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow."
- SERVANT.
- "God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, mine own fortune in my misery."
- "SERVANT.\nPerhaps you have learned it without book."
- "But I pray, can you read anything you see?"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, If I know the letters and the language."
- "SERVANT.\nYe say honestly, rest you merry!"
- "ROMEO.\nStay, fellow; I can read."
- "[_He reads the letter._]"
- _Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
- "County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\nThe lady widow of Utruvio;"
- "Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;\nMercutio and his brother Valentine;"
- "Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;"
- "My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;"
- Lucio and the lively Helena. _
- A fair assembly.
- "[_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?"
- "SERVANT.\nUp.\n\nROMEO.\nWhither to supper?\n\nSERVANT.\nTo our house."
- "ROMEO.\nWhose house?\n\nSERVANT.\nMy master’s."
- "ROMEO.\nIndeed I should have ask’d you that before."
- SERVANT.
- Now I’ll tell you without asking.
- "My master is the great rich Capulet,"
- "and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush"
- "a\ncup of wine. Rest you merry.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAt this same ancient feast of Capulet’s"
- Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
- With all the admired beauties of Verona.
- "Go thither and with unattainted eye,"
- "Compare her face with some that I shall show,"
- And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
- "ROMEO.\nWhen the devout religion of mine eye"
- "Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;"
- "And these who, often drown’d, could never die,"
- "Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars."
- One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
- Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,"
- "Herself pois’d with herself in either eye:"
- But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d
- Your lady’s love against some other maid
- "That I will show you shining at this feast,"
- And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
- "ROMEO.\nI’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,"
- But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House."
- Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.
- LADY CAPULET.
- "Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me."
- "NURSE.\nNow, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,"
- "I bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!"
- "God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!\n\n Enter Juliet."
- "JULIET.\nHow now, who calls?\n\nNURSE.\nYour mother."
- "JULIET.\nMadam, I am here. What is your will?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThis is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,"
- "We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,"
- "I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel."
- Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.
- "NURSE.\nFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nShe’s not fourteen."
- "NURSE.\nI’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,"
- "And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,"
- "She is not fourteen. How long is it now\nTo Lammas-tide?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nA fortnight and odd days."
- "NURSE.\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,"
- Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
- "Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—"
- "Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;"
- "She was too good for me. But as I said,"
- On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
- "That shall she, marry; I remember it well."
- ’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
- "And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,"
- "Of all the days of the year, upon that day:"
- "For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,"
- Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
- "My lord and you were then at Mantua:"
- "Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,"
- When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
- "Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,"
- "To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!"
- "Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I"
- "trow,\nTo bid me trudge."
- And since that time it is eleven years;
- "For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood"
- She could have run and waddled all about;
- "For even the day before she broke her brow,"
- "And then my husband,—God be with his soul!"
- "A was a merry man,—took up the child:"
- "‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy"
- "face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;"
- "Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,"
- "The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’."
- To see now how a jest shall come about.
- "I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,"
- "I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’"
- quoth he;
- "And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace."
- "NURSE.\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,"
- "To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;"
- And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
- A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
- "A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly."
- "‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy"
- "face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;"
- "Wilt thou not, Jule?’"
- "it stinted, and said ‘Ay’."
- "JULIET.\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I."
- "NURSE.\nPeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace"
- Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I
- "nurs’d:"
- "And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nMarry, that marry is the very theme"
- "I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,"
- How stands your disposition to be married?
- "JULIET.\nIt is an honour that I dream not of."
- "NURSE.\nAn honour! Were not I thine only nurse,"
- I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, think of marriage now: younger than you,"
- "Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\nAre made already mothers. By my count"
- I was your mother much upon these years
- "That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;"
- The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
- "NURSE.\nA man, young lady! Lady, such a man"
- As all the world—why he’s a man of wax.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nVerona’s summer hath not such a flower."
- "NURSE.\nNay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhat say you, can you love the gentleman?"
- This night you shall behold him at our feast;
- "Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,"
- And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
- "Examine every married lineament,\nAnd see how one another lends content;"
- "And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,"
- Find written in the margent of his eyes.
- "This precious book of love, this unbound lover,"
- "To beautify him, only lacks a cover:"
- The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride
- For fair without the fair within to hide.
- "That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,"
- That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
- "So shall you share all that he doth possess,"
- "By having him, making yourself no less."
- "NURSE.\nNo less, nay bigger. Women grow by men."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?"
- "JULIET.\nI’ll look to like, if looking liking move:"
- But no more deep will I endart mine eye
- "Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\n\n Enter a Servant."
- SERVANT.
- "Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young"
- lady
- "asked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity"
- ".\nI must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWe follow thee.\n\n [_Exit Servant._]"
- "Juliet, the County stays."
- "NURSE.\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Street."
- "Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;"
- Torch-bearers and others.
- "ROMEO.\nWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?"
- Or shall we on without apology?
- "BENVOLIO.\nThe date is out of such prolixity:"
- "We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,"
- "Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,"
- Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
- "Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke"
- "After the prompter, for our entrance:"
- "But let them measure us by what they will,"
- "We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone."
- "ROMEO.\nGive me a torch, I am not for this ambling;"
- Being but heavy I will bear the light.
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance."
- "ROMEO.\nNot I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,"
- "With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead"
- So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
- "MERCUTIO.\nYou are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,"
- And soar with them above a common bound.
- "ROMEO.\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft"
- "To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,"
- I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
- Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.
- "MERCUTIO.\nAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;"
- Too great oppression for a tender thing.
- "ROMEO.\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,"
- "Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn."
- "MERCUTIO.\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;"
- "Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down."
- "Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a"
- "mask._]\nA visor for a visor. What care I"
- What curious eye doth quote deformities?
- Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in"
- But every man betake him to his legs.
- "ROMEO.\nA torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,"
- Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
- "For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,"
- "I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,"
- "The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:"
- "If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire"
- "Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest"
- "Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho."
- "ROMEO.\nNay, that’s not so."
- "MERCUTIO.\nI mean sir, in delay"
- "We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day."
- "Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits"
- Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
- "ROMEO.\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;"
- "But ’tis no wit to go.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWhy, may one ask?"
- "ROMEO.\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAnd so did I."
- "ROMEO.\nWell what was yours?\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThat dreamers often lie."
- "ROMEO.\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true."
- "MERCUTIO.\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you."
- "She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes"
- In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
- "On the fore-finger of an alderman,"
- Drawn with a team of little atomies
- "Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:"
- Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
- "The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;"
- "Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;"
- "The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;"
- "Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;"
- "Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,"
- Not half so big as a round little worm
- "Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:"
- "Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,"
- "Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,"
- Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
- And in this state she gallops night by night
- "Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;"
- "O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;"
- "O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;"
- "O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,"
- "Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,"
- "Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:"
- "Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,"
- And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
- "And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,"
- "Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,"
- "Then dreams he of another benefice:"
- "Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,"
- "And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,"
- "Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,"
- Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
- "Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;"
- "And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,"
- And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
- That plats the manes of horses in the night;
- "And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,"
- "Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:"
- "This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,"
- "That presses them, and learns them first to bear,"
- "Making them women of good carriage:\nThis is she,—"
- "ROMEO.\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,"
- Thou talk’st of nothing.
- "MERCUTIO.\nTrue, I talk of dreams,"
- "Which are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,"
- "Which is as thin of substance as the air,"
- "And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes"
- "Even now the frozen bosom of the north,"
- "And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,"
- Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.
- "BENVOLIO.\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:"
- "Supper is done, and we shall come too late."
- "ROMEO.\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives"
- "Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date"
- With this night’s revels; and expire the term
- "Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast"
- By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
- But he that hath the steerage of my course
- "Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!\n\nBENVOLIO.\nStrike, drum."
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- SCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.
- Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.
- "FIRST SERVANT.\nWhere’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?"
- He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!
- SECOND SERVANT.
- "When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and"
- "they\nunwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing."
- FIRST SERVANT.
- "Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to"
- the
- plate.
- "Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves"
- "me,\nlet the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan!"
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nAy, boy, ready."
- FIRST SERVANT.
- "You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the"
- great chamber.
- SECOND SERVANT.
- "We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys."
- "Be brisk awhile, and\nthe longer liver take all."
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- "Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers."
- "CAPULET.\nWelcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes"
- Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.
- "Ah my mistresses, which of you all"
- "Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,"
- She I’ll swear hath corns.
- "Am I come near ye now?\nWelcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day"
- "That I have worn a visor, and could tell"
- "A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,"
- "Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis"
- "gone,\nYou are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play."
- "A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls."
- "[_Music plays, and they dance._]"
- "More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,"
- "And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot."
- "Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well."
- "Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,"
- For you and I are past our dancing days;
- "How long is’t now since last yourself and I\nWere in a mask?"
- "CAPULET’S COUSIN.\nBy’r Lady, thirty years."
- CAPULET.
- "What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:"
- "’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,"
- "Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,"
- Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.
- CAPULET’S COUSIN.
- "’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;"
- His son is thirty.
- "CAPULET.\nWill you tell me that?"
- His son was but a ward two years ago.
- "ROMEO.\nWhat lady is that, which doth enrich the hand"
- "Of yonder knight?\n\nSERVANT.\nI know not, sir."
- "ROMEO.\nO, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!"
- It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
- As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;
- "Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!"
- So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
- As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
- "The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,"
- "And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand."
- "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!"
- For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.
- "TYBALT.\nThis by his voice, should be a Montague."
- "Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave"
- "Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,"
- To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
- "Now by the stock and honour of my kin,"
- To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
- "CAPULET.\nWhy how now, kinsman!\nWherefore storm you so?"
- "TYBALT.\nUncle, this is a Montague, our foe;"
- "A villain that is hither come in spite,"
- To scorn at our solemnity this night.
- "CAPULET.\nYoung Romeo, is it?"
- "TYBALT.\n’Tis he, that villain Romeo."
- "CAPULET.\nContent thee, gentle coz, let him alone,"
- A bears him like a portly gentleman;
- "And, to say truth, Verona brags of him"
- To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.
- I would not for the wealth of all the town
- Here in my house do him disparagement.
- "Therefore be patient, take no note of him,"
- "It is my will; the which if thou respect,"
- "Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,"
- An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
- "TYBALT.\nIt fits when such a villain is a guest:"
- I’ll not endure him.
- "CAPULET.\nHe shall be endur’d."
- "What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;"
- "Am I the master here, or you? Go to."
- "You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,"
- You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
- "You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!"
- "TYBALT.\nWhy, uncle, ’tis a shame."
- "CAPULET.\nGo to, go to!"
- "You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?"
- "This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what."
- "You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time."
- "Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:"
- "Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!"
- "I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts."
- "TYBALT.\nPatience perforce with wilful choler meeting"
- Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
- "I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,"
- "Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- ROMEO.
- "[_To Juliet."
- "_] If I profane with my unworthiest hand"
- "This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,"
- "My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand"
- To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
- "JULIET.\nGood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,"
- Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
- "For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,"
- And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.
- "ROMEO.\nHave not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
- "JULIET.\nAy, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
- "ROMEO.\nO, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:"
- "They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
- "JULIET.\nSaints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake."
- "ROMEO.\nThen move not while my prayer’s effect I take."
- "Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d."
- "[_Kissing her._]"
- "JULIET.\nThen have my lips the sin that they have took."
- "ROMEO.\nSin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!"
- "Give me my sin again.\n\nJULIET.\nYou kiss by the book."
- "NURSE.\nMadam, your mother craves a word with you."
- "ROMEO.\nWhat is her mother?"
- "NURSE.\nMarry, bachelor,\nHer mother is the lady of the house,"
- "And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous."
- I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal.
- "I tell you, he that can lay hold of her"
- Shall have the chinks.
- "ROMEO.\nIs she a Capulet?"
- O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.
- "BENVOLIO.\nAway, be gone; the sport is at the best."
- "ROMEO.\nAy, so I fear; the more is my unrest."
- "CAPULET.\nNay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,"
- We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
- "Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;"
- "I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night."
- "More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed."
- "Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,"
- I’ll to my rest.
- "[_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._]"
- "JULIET.\nCome hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?"
- "NURSE.\nThe son and heir of old Tiberio."
- "JULIET.\nWhat’s he that now is going out of door?"
- "NURSE.\nMarry, that I think be young Petruchio."
- "JULIET.\nWhat’s he that follows here, that would not dance?"
- "NURSE.\nI know not."
- "JULIET.\nGo ask his name. If he be married,"
- My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
- "NURSE.\nHis name is Romeo, and a Montague,"
- The only son of your great enemy.
- "JULIET.\nMy only love sprung from my only hate!"
- "Too early seen unknown, and known too late!"
- "Prodigious birth of love it is to me,"
- That I must love a loathed enemy.
- "NURSE.\nWhat’s this? What’s this?"
- "JULIET.\nA rhyme I learn’d even now"
- Of one I danc’d withal.
- "[_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]"
- "NURSE.\nAnon, anon!"
- "Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone."
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- "ACT II\n\n Enter Chorus."
- "CHORUS.\nNow old desire doth in his deathbed lie,"
- And young affection gapes to be his heir;
- "That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,"
- "With tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair."
- "Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,"
- Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
- "But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,"
- "And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:"
- "Being held a foe, he may not have access"
- To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
- "And she as much in love, her means much less"
- To meet her new beloved anywhere.
- "But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,"
- "Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "SCENE I. An open place adjoining Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "ROMEO.\nCan I go forward when my heart is here?"
- "Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out."
- "[_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]"
- "Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nRomeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!"
- "MERCUTIO.\nHe is wise,"
- And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.
- "BENVOLIO.\nHe ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:"
- "Call, good Mercutio."
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, I’ll conjure too."
- Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover!
- "Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,"
- "Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;"
- Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;
- "Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,"
- "One nickname for her purblind son and heir,"
- "Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim"
- When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
- "He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;"
- "The ape is dead, and I must conjure him."
- "I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,"
- "By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,"
- "By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,"
- "And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,"
- That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
- "BENVOLIO.\nAn if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him."
- "MERCUTIO.\nThis cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him"
- "To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,"
- "Of some strange nature, letting it there stand"
- "Till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;"
- That were some spite. My invocation
- "Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,"
- I conjure only but to raise up him.
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, he hath hid himself among these trees"
- To be consorted with the humorous night.
- "Blind is his love, and best befits the dark."
- "MERCUTIO.\nIf love be blind, love cannot hit the mark."
- "Now will he sit under a medlar tree,"
- And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
- As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
- "O Romeo, that she were, O that she were"
- An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
- "Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed."
- This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
- "Come, shall we go?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGo then; for ’tis in vain"
- To seek him here that means not to be found.
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Capulet’s Garden."
- "Enter Romeo.\n\nROMEO.\nHe jests at scars that never felt a wound."
- Juliet appears above at a window.
- "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?"
- "It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"
- "Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,"
- "Who is already sick and pale with grief,"
- That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
- Be not her maid since she is envious;
- "Her vestal livery is but sick and green,"
- And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
- "It is my lady, O it is my love!"
- "O, that she knew she were!"
- "She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?"
- "Her eye discourses, I will answer it."
- "I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks."
- "Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,"
- "Having some business, do entreat her eyes"
- To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
- "What if her eyes were there, they in her head?"
- "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,"
- As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
- Would through the airy region stream so bright
- That birds would sing and think it were not night.
- See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
- "O that I were a glove upon that hand,"
- "That I might touch that cheek.\n\nJULIET.\nAy me."
- "ROMEO.\nShe speaks.\nO speak again bright angel, for thou art"
- "As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,"
- "As is a winged messenger of heaven\nUnto the white-upturned wondering eyes"
- Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
- When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
- And sails upon the bosom of the air.
- "JULIET.\nO Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"
- Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
- "Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,"
- And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
- ROMEO.
- "[_Aside."
- "_] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"
- "JULIET.\n’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;"
- "Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."
- "What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,"
- "Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part"
- Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
- What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
- By any other name would smell as sweet;
- "So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,"
- Retain that dear perfection which he owes
- "Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,"
- "And for thy name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself."
- "ROMEO.\nI take thee at thy word."
- "Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d"
- ";\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo."
- "JULIET.\nWhat man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night"
- So stumblest on my counsel?
- "ROMEO.\nBy a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:"
- "My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,"
- Because it is an enemy to thee.
- "Had I it written, I would tear the word."
- "JULIET.\nMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words"
- "Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound."
- "Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?"
- "ROMEO.\nNeither, fair maid, if either thee dislike."
- JULIET.
- "How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?"
- "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,"
- "And the place death, considering who thou art,"
- If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
- ROMEO.
- "With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,"
- "For stony limits cannot hold love out,"
- "And what love can do, that dares love attempt:"
- Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
- "JULIET.\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee."
- "ROMEO.\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye"
- "Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,"
- And I am proof against their enmity.
- "JULIET.\nI would not for the world they saw thee here."
- "ROMEO.\nI have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,"
- "And but thou love me, let them find me here."
- My life were better ended by their hate
- "Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love."
- "JULIET.\nBy whose direction found’st thou out this place?"
- "ROMEO.\nBy love, that first did prompt me to enquire;"
- "He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes."
- I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far
- "As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,"
- I should adventure for such merchandise.
- "JULIET.\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,"
- Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
- For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
- "Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny"
- What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.
- "Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,"
- "And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,"
- "Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,"
- "They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,"
- "If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully."
- "Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,"
- "I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,"
- "So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world."
- "In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;"
- "And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:"
- "But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true"
- Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
- "I should have been more strange, I must confess,"
- "But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,"
- "My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,"
- "And not impute this yielding to light love,"
- Which the dark night hath so discovered.
- "ROMEO.\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,"
- "That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—"
- JULIET.
- "O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,"
- "That monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable."
- "ROMEO.\nWhat shall I swear by?"
- "JULIET.\nDo not swear at all."
- "Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,"
- "Which is the god of my idolatry,"
- And I’ll believe thee.
- "ROMEO.\nIf my heart’s dear love,—"
- "JULIET.\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,"
- I have no joy of this contract tonight;
- "It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,"
- "Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be"
- "Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night."
- "This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,"
- May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
- "Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest"
- Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
- "ROMEO.\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
- "JULIET.\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?"
- "ROMEO.\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine."
- "JULIET.\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;"
- And yet I would it were to give again.
- "ROMEO.\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?"
- "JULIET.\nBut to be frank and give it thee again."
- And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
- "My bounty is as boundless as the sea,"
- "My love as deep; the more I give to thee,"
- "The more I have, for both are infinite."
- "I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu."
- "[_Nurse calls within._]"
- "Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true."
- "Stay but a little, I will come again.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "ROMEO.\nO blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,"
- "Being in night, all this is but a dream,"
- "Too flattering sweet to be substantial.\n\n Enter Juliet above."
- "JULIET.\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed."
- "If that thy bent of love be honourable,"
- "Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,"
- "By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,"
- "Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,"
- And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay
- And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
- "NURSE.\n[_Within._] Madam."
- JULIET.
- "I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,"
- "I do beseech thee,—"
- "NURSE.\n[_Within._] Madam."
- "JULIET.\nBy and by I come—"
- "To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.\nTomorrow will I send."
- "ROMEO.\nSo thrive my soul,—\n\nJULIET.\nA thousand times good night."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "ROMEO.\nA thousand times the worse, to want thy light."
- "Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,"
- "But love from love, towards school with heavy looks."
- "[_Retiring slowly._]\n\n Re-enter Juliet, above."
- JULIET.
- "Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice"
- To lure this tassel-gentle back again.
- "Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,"
- "Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,"
- And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
- With repetition of my Romeo’s name.
- "ROMEO.\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name."
- "How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,"
- "Like softest music to attending ears.\n\nJULIET.\nRomeo."
- "ROMEO.\nMy nyas?"
- "JULIET.\nWhat o’clock tomorrow\nShall I send to thee?"
- "ROMEO.\nBy the hour of nine."
- "JULIET.\nI will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then."
- I have forgot why I did call thee back.
- "ROMEO.\nLet me stand here till thou remember it."
- "JULIET.\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,"
- Remembering how I love thy company.
- "ROMEO.\nAnd I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,"
- Forgetting any other home but this.
- "JULIET.\n’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,"
- "And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,"
- "That lets it hop a little from her hand,"
- "Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,"
- "And with a silk thread plucks it back again,"
- So loving-jealous of his liberty.
- "ROMEO.\nI would I were thy bird."
- "JULIET.\nSweet, so would I:"
- Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
- "Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow"
- That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
- "[_Exit._]"
- "ROMEO.\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast."
- "Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest."
- "The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,"
- Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
- And darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels
- "From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheels"
- "Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,"
- His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
- "[_Exit._]\n\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell."
- Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,"
- "The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,"
- I must upfill this osier cage of ours
- With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
- "The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;"
- "What is her burying grave, that is her womb:"
- And from her womb children of divers kind
- "We sucking on her natural bosom find.\nMany for many virtues excellent,"
- "None but for some, and yet all different."
- "O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies"
- "In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities."
- For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
- But to the earth some special good doth give;
- "Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,"
- "Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse."
- "Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied,"
- "And vice sometime’s by action dignified.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- Within the infant rind of this weak flower
- "Poison hath residence, and medicine power:"
- "For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;"
- "Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart."
- Two such opposed kings encamp them still
- "In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;"
- "And where the worser is predominant,"
- Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
- "ROMEO.\nGood morrow, father."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBenedicite!\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?"
- "Young son, it argues a distemper’d head"
- So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
- "Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,"
- And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
- But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
- "Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign."
- Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
- Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
- "Or if not so, then here I hit it right,"
- Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
- "ROMEO.\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?"
- "ROMEO.\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No."
- "I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe."
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?
- "ROMEO.\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again."
- "I have been feasting with mine enemy,"
- Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
- That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
- Within thy help and holy physic lies.
- "I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,"
- My intercession likewise steads my foe.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;"
- Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
- "ROMEO.\nThen plainly know my heart’s dear love is set"
- On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
- "As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;"
- "And all combin’d, save what thou must combine"
- "By holy marriage. When, and where, and how"
- "We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,"
- "I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,"
- That thou consent to marry us today.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHoly Saint Francis! What a change is here!"
- "Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,"
- So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
- "Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes."
- "Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine"
- Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
- "How much salt water thrown away in waste,"
- "To season love, that of it doth not taste."
- "The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,"
- Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
- Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
- Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
- "If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine"
- ",\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,"
- "And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,"
- "Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men."
- "ROMEO.\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd bad’st me bury love."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNot in a grave"
- "To lay one in, another out to have."
- "ROMEO.\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now"
- "Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.\nThe other did not so."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, she knew well"
- "Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell."
- "But come young waverer, come go with me,"
- In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
- "For this alliance may so happy prove,"
- To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.
- "ROMEO.\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Street."
- Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
- "MERCUTIO.\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments"
- "him so\nthat he will sure run mad."
- BENVOLIO.
- "Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his"
- "father’s\nhouse.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nA challenge, on my life."
- "BENVOLIO.\nRomeo will answer it."
- "MERCUTIO.\nAny man that can write may answer a letter."
- BENVOLIO.
- "Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares,"
- being dared.
- MERCUTIO.
- "Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white"
- wench’s black
- "eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his"
- heart
- cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft.
- "And is he a man to encounter\nTybalt?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhy, what is Tybalt?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "More than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of"
- compliments.
- "He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,"
- and proportion.
- "He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in"
- "your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist,"
- a duellist;
- "a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause."
- "Ah,"
- "the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay."
- "BENVOLIO.\nThe what?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies;"
- these new tuners
- of accent.
- "By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good"
- whore.
- "Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that"
- we should
- "be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,"
- "these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that"
- they cannot
- "sit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!"
- "Enter Romeo.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!"
- MERCUTIO.
- "Without his roe, like a dried herring."
- "O flesh, flesh, how art thou"
- fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in.
- "Laura, to"
- "his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a"
- better love to
- "berhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and"
- Hero hildings
- "and harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the"
- purpose. Signior
- "Romeo, bonjour!"
- There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You
- gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
- "ROMEO.\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?"
- ROMEO.
- "Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as"
- mine a man may strain courtesy.
- MERCUTIO.
- "That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours"
- "constrains a man to bow\nin the hams."
- "ROMEO.\nMeaning, to curtsy."
- "MERCUTIO.\nThou hast most kindly hit it."
- "ROMEO.\nA most courteous exposition."
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy."
- "ROMEO.\nPink for flower.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nRight."
- "ROMEO.\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out"
- "thy pump,"
- "that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after"
- "the\nwearing, solely singular."
- ROMEO.
- "O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!"
- "MERCUTIO.\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint."
- ROMEO.
- "Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match"
- "."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done."
- For thou hast
- "more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure"
- ", I have in my"
- whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
- ROMEO.
- "Thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for"
- "the\ngoose."
- "MERCUTIO.\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest."
- "ROMEO.\nNay, good goose, bite not."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "O here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch"
- "narrow to an\nell broad."
- ROMEO.
- "I stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves"
- thee far and wide a broad goose.
- MERCUTIO.
- "Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou"
- "sociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by"
- art as
- "well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,"
- that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
- ".\n\nBENVOLIO.\nStop there, stop there."
- "MERCUTIO.\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair."
- "BENVOLIO.\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large."
- MERCUTIO.
- "O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for"
- I was come to the
- "whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\nlonger."
- Enter Nurse and Peter.
- "ROMEO.\nHere’s goodly gear!\nA sail, a sail!"
- "MERCUTIO.\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock."
- "NURSE.\nPeter!\n\nPETER.\nAnon.\n\nNURSE.\nMy fan, Peter."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer"
- "face.\n\nNURSE.\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen."
- "MERCUTIO.\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman."
- "NURSE.\nIs it good-den?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of"
- "the dial is now upon the\nprick of noon."
- "NURSE.\nOut upon you! What a man are you?"
- ROMEO.
- "One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar."
- NURSE.
- "By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar,"
- "quoth a? Gentlemen,"
- can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
- ROMEO.
- "I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him"
- than he was when you sought him.
- "I am the youngest of that name, for\nfault of a worse."
- "NURSE.\nYou say well."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Yea, is the worst well?"
- "Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely."
- "NURSE.\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you."
- "BENVOLIO.\nShe will endite him to some supper."
- MERCUTIO.
- "A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat hast thou found?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie"
- ", that is something\nstale and hoar ere it be spent."
- "[_Sings._]\n    An old hare hoar,"
- "And an old hare hoar,\n  Is very good meat in Lent;"
- "But a hare that is hoar\n    Is too much for a score"
- When it hoars ere it be spent.
- "Romeo, will you come to your father’s?"
- "We’ll to dinner thither.\n\nROMEO.\nI will follow you."
- "MERCUTIO.\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady."
- "[_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]"
- NURSE.
- "I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so"
- "full of his\nropery?"
- ROMEO.
- "A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak"
- more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
- NURSE.
- "And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a"
- were lustier
- "than he is, and twenty such Jacks."
- "And if I cannot, I’ll find those"
- that shall. Scurvy knave!
- I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of
- his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every
- "knave to\nuse me at his pleasure!"
- PETER.
- "I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon"
- should
- "quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another"
- "man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my"
- side.
- NURSE.
- "Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me"
- quivers. Scurvy
- knave.
- "Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young"
- lady bid me
- "enquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep"
- to myself. But first
- "let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise"
- ", as they"
- "say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for"
- "the\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with"
- "her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman,"
- "and\nvery weak dealing."
- "ROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress."
- "I protest unto\nthee,—"
- NURSE.
- "Good heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much."
- "Lord, Lord, she will\nbe a joyful woman."
- ROMEO.
- "What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me."
- NURSE.
- "I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I"
- "take it, is a\ngentlemanlike offer."
- "ROMEO.\nBid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,"
- And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell
- Be shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.
- "NURSE.\nNo truly, sir; not a penny."
- "ROMEO.\nGo to; I say you shall."
- "NURSE.\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall."
- "Within this hour my man shall be with thee,"
- "And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,"
- Which to the high topgallant of my joy
- Must be my convoy in the secret night.
- "Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;"
- Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
- "NURSE.\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir."
- "ROMEO.\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?"
- "NURSE.\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,"
- "Two may keep counsel, putting one away?"
- "ROMEO.\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel."
- NURSE.
- "Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!"
- When ’twas a
- "little prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one"
- "Paris, that"
- "would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as"
- lief see a
- "toad, a very toad, as see him."
- "I anger her sometimes, and tell her that"
- "Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I"
- "say so, she"
- looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.
- "Doth not rosemary and\nRomeo begin both with a letter?"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R."
- NURSE.
- "Ah, mocker! That’s the dog’s name."
- "R is for the—no, I know it begins"
- "with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious"
- "of it,"
- "of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it."
- "ROMEO.\nCommend me to thy lady."
- "NURSE.\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!"
- "[_Exit Romeo._]\n\nPETER.\nAnon."
- "NURSE.\nBefore and apace.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "SCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Juliet."
- "JULIET.\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,"
- In half an hour she promised to return.
- Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.
- "O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,"
- "Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,"
- "Driving back shadows over lowering hills:"
- "Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,"
- And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
- Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
- "Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve"
- "Is three long hours, yet she is not come."
- "Had she affections and warm youthful blood,"
- She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
- "My words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me."
- "But old folks, many feign as they were dead;"
- "Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\n\n Enter Nurse and Peter."
- "O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?"
- Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
- "NURSE.\nPeter, stay at the gate.\n\n [_Exit Peter._]"
- JULIET.
- "Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad"
- "?\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;"
- "If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news"
- By playing it to me with so sour a face.
- "NURSE.\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;"
- "Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!"
- "JULIET.\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:"
- "Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak."
- NURSE.
- "Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while?"
- "Do you not see that I am\nout of breath?"
- "JULIET.\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath"
- To say to me that thou art out of breath?
- The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
- Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
- Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;
- "Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance."
- "Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?"
- NURSE.
- "Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a"
- man.
- "Romeo? No, not he."
- "Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his"
- "leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot,"
- "and a body, though"
- "they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare."
- He is not the
- "flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb."
- Go thy
- "ways, wench, serve God."
- "What, have you dined at home?"
- "JULIET.\nNo, no. But all this did I know before."
- What says he of our marriage? What of that?
- "NURSE.\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!"
- It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
- "My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my"
- "back!\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about"
- To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
- "JULIET.\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well."
- "Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?"
- "NURSE.\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,"
- "And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,"
- "And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?"
- "JULIET.\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within."
- Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest.
- "‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,"
- ‘Where is your mother?’
- "NURSE.\nO God’s lady dear,"
- "Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow."
- Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
- Henceforward do your messages yourself.
- "JULIET.\nHere’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?"
- "NURSE.\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?"
- "JULIET.\nI have."
- "NURSE.\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;"
- There stays a husband to make you a wife.
- "Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,"
- They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
- "Hie you to church. I must another way,"
- To fetch a ladder by the which your love
- Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
- "I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;"
- But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
- Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
- "JULIET.\nHie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell."
- Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act"
- That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
- "ROMEO.\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,"
- It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
- That one short minute gives me in her sight.
- "Do thou but close our hands with holy words,"
- "Then love-devouring death do what he dare,"
- It is enough I may but call her mine.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThese violent delights have violent ends,"
- "And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,"
- Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
- "Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,"
- And in the taste confounds the appetite.
- "Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;"
- "Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\n\n Enter Juliet."
- "Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot"
- Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.
- A lover may bestride the gossamers
- That idles in the wanton summer air
- And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
- "JULIET.\nGood even to my ghostly confessor."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both."
- "JULIET.\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much."
- "ROMEO.\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy"
- "Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more"
- "To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath"
- "This neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue"
- Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
- Receive in either by this dear encounter.
- "JULIET.\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,"
- "Brags of his substance, not of ornament."
- They are but beggars that can count their worth;
- "But my true love is grown to such excess,"
- I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,"
- "For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone"
- "Till holy church incorporate two in one.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "ACT III\n\nSCENE I. A public Place."
- "Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants."
- "BENVOLIO.\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:"
- "The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,"
- "And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,"
- "For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of"
- "a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God"
- send me no
- need of thee!’
- and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
- "drawer, when indeed there is no need."
- "BENVOLIO.\nAm I like such a fellow?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in"
- Italy; and as
- "soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved."
- "BENVOLIO.\nAnd what to?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one"
- would
- kill the other. Thou?
- "Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a"
- hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
- Thou wilt quarrel
- "with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou"
- hast hazel eyes.
- What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
- "Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat,"
- and yet thy
- head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling.
- Thou hast
- "quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath"
- wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.
- Didst thou not fall
- out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
- another for tying his new shoes with an old riband?
- "And yet thou wilt\ntutor me from quarrelling!"
- BENVOLIO.
- "And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the"
- "fee\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter."
- "MERCUTIO.\nThe fee simple! O simple!\n\n Enter Tybalt and others."
- "BENVOLIO.\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets."
- "MERCUTIO.\nBy my heel, I care not."
- "TYBALT.\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them."
- "Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you."
- MERCUTIO.
- And but one word with one of us?
- "Couple it with something; make it a\nword and a blow."
- TYBALT.
- "You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me"
- "occasion.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?"
- "TYBALT.\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo."
- MERCUTIO.
- "Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?"
- And thou make minstrels of
- "us, look to hear nothing but discords."
- "Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s"
- "that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men."
- "Either withdraw unto some private place,\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,"
- Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
- "MERCUTIO.\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze."
- "I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "TYBALT.\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man."
- MERCUTIO.
- "But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery."
- "Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;"
- Your worship in that sense may call him man.
- "TYBALT.\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford"
- "No better term than this: Thou art a villain."
- "ROMEO.\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee"
- Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
- To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
- Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.
- "TYBALT.\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries"
- "That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw."
- "ROMEO.\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,"
- But love thee better than thou canst devise
- Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
- "And so good Capulet, which name I tender"
- "As dearly as mine own, be satisfied."
- "MERCUTIO.\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!"
- "[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away."
- "Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?"
- "TYBALT.\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean"
- to
- "make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,"
- dry-beat the rest
- of the eight.
- Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
- "Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out."
- "TYBALT.\n[_Drawing._] I am for you."
- "ROMEO.\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up."
- "MERCUTIO.\nCome, sir, your passado."
- "[_They fight._]"
- "ROMEO.\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons."
- "Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,"
- "Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath"
- "Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.\nHold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!"
- "[_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]"
- "MERCUTIO.\nI am hurt."
- A plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.
- "Is he gone, and hath nothing?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhat, art thou hurt?"
- MERCUTIO.
- "Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch."
- "Marry, ’tis enough."
- "Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon."
- "[_Exit Page._]"
- "ROMEO.\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much."
- MERCUTIO.
- "No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a"
- "church door, but ’tis"
- "enough, ’twill serve."
- "Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a"
- "grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world."
- A plague o’ both
- your houses.
- "Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch"
- a man to
- death.
- "A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of"
- arithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your
- "arm.\n\nROMEO.\nI thought all for the best."
- "MERCUTIO.\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,"
- Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.
- They have made worms’ meat of me.
- "I have it, and soundly too. Your houses!"
- "[_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]"
- "ROMEO.\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,"
- "My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt"
- In my behalf; my reputation stain’d
- "With Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour"
- "Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,"
- Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
- And in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.
- Re-enter Benvolio.
- "BENVOLIO.\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,"
- "That gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,"
- Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
- "ROMEO.\nThis day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;"
- "This but begins the woe others must end.\n\n Re-enter Tybalt."
- "BENVOLIO.\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again."
- "ROMEO.\nAgain in triumph, and Mercutio slain?"
- "Away to heaven respective lenity,"
- And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!
- "Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again"
- "That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul"
- "Is but a little way above our heads,"
- Staying for thine to keep him company.
- "Either thou or I, or both, must go with him."
- "TYBALT.\nThou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,"
- "Shalt with him hence.\n\nROMEO.\nThis shall determine that."
- "[_They fight; Tybalt falls._]"
- "BENVOLIO.\nRomeo, away, be gone!"
- "The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain."
- Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death
- "If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!"
- "ROMEO.\nO, I am fortune’s fool!"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhy dost thou stay?\n\n [_Exit Romeo._]"
- Enter Citizens.
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nWhich way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?"
- "Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThere lies that Tybalt."
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nUp, sir, go with me."
- I charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.
- "Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others."
- "PRINCE.\nWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nO noble Prince, I can discover all"
- The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
- "There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,"
- "That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nTybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!"
- "O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d"
- "Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,"
- "For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\nO cousin, cousin."
- "PRINCE.\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;"
- "Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink"
- "How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal"
- Your high displeasure. All this uttered
- "With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d"
- Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
- "Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts"
- "With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,"
- "Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,"
- "And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats"
- "Cold death aside, and with the other sends"
- "It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,"
- "‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’"
- "and swifter than his tongue,\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,"
- And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
- An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
- "Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled."
- "But by and by comes back to Romeo,"
- "Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,"
- "And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I"
- Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;
- And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
- "This is the truth, or let Benvolio die."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague."
- "Affection makes him false, he speaks not true."
- "Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,"
- And all those twenty could but kill one life.
- "I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;"
- "Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live."
- "PRINCE.\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio."
- Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
- "MONTAGUE.\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;"
- "His fault concludes but what the law should end,\nThe life of Tybalt."
- "PRINCE.\nAnd for that offence\nImmediately we do exile him hence."
- "I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,"
- My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
- But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine
- That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
- I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
- Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
- "Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,"
- "Else, when he is found, that hour is his last."
- "Bear hence this body, and attend our will."
- "Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "SCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Juliet."
- "JULIET.\nGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,"
- Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner
- "As Phaeton would whip you to the west\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately."
- "Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,"
- "That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo"
- "Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen."
- Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
- "By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,"
- "It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,"
- "Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,"
- "And learn me how to lose a winning match,"
- Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
- "Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,"
- "With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,"
- Think true love acted simple modesty.
- "Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;"
- For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
- Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
- "Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,"
- "Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,"
- "Take him and cut him out in little stars,"
- And he will make the face of heaven so fine
- "That all the world will be in love with night,"
- And pay no worship to the garish sun.
- "O, I have bought the mansion of a love,"
- "But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,"
- Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day
- "As is the night before some festival\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes"
- "And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,"
- "And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks"
- But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.
- "Enter Nurse, with cords."
- "Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?"
- The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?
- "NURSE.\nAy, ay, the cords."
- "[_Throws them down._]"
- JULIET.
- "Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?"
- NURSE.
- "Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s"
- "dead, he’s dead!"
- "We are undone, lady, we are undone."
- "Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d,"
- "he’s dead.\n\nJULIET.\nCan heaven be so envious?"
- "NURSE.\nRomeo can,\nThough heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo."
- Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
- "JULIET.\nWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?"
- This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
- "Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,"
- And that bare vowel I shall poison more
- Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
- I am not I if there be such an I;
- Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.
- "If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No."
- Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
- "NURSE.\nI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,"
- God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
- "A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;"
- "Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,"
- All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
- JULIET.
- "O, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once."
- "To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty."
- "Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,"
- And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.
- "NURSE.\nO Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had."
- "O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!"
- That ever I should live to see thee dead.
- "JULIET.\nWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?"
- Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?
- "My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?"
- "Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,"
- "For who is living, if those two are gone?"
- "NURSE.\nTybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,"
- "Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished."
- "JULIET.\nO God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?"
- "NURSE.\nIt did, it did; alas the day, it did."
- "JULIET.\nO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!"
- Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
- "Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,"
- "Dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!"
- Despised substance of divinest show!
- "Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,"
- "A damned saint, an honourable villain!"
- "O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell"
- When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
- "In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?\nWas ever book containing such vile matter"
- "So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell"
- In such a gorgeous palace.
- "NURSE.\nThere’s no trust,"
- "No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,"
- "All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers."
- "Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae."
- "These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old."
- Shame come to Romeo.
- "JULIET.\nBlister’d be thy tongue"
- For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
- Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
- For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d
- Sole monarch of the universal earth.
- "O, what a beast was I to chide at him!"
- "NURSE.\nWill you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?"
- "JULIET.\nShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?"
- "Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,"
- When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
- "But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?"
- That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
- "Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,"
- "Your tributary drops belong to woe,"
- Which you mistaking offer up to joy.
- "My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,"
- "And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband."
- All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
- "Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,"
- "That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,"
- "But O, it presses to my memory"
- Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.
- "Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished."
- "That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’"
- Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
- "Was woe enough, if it had ended there."
- "Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,"
- "And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,"
- "Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,"
- "Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,"
- Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
- "But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,"
- ‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word
- "Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,"
- "All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,"
- "There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,"
- "In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound."
- "Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?"
- "NURSE.\nWeeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse."
- Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
- "JULIET.\nWash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,"
- "When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment."
- "Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,"
- Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.
- "He made you for a highway to my bed,"
- "But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed."
- "Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,"
- "And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead."
- "NURSE.\nHie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo"
- To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
- "Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night."
- "I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell."
- "JULIET.\nO find him, give this ring to my true knight,"
- "And bid him come to take his last farewell.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man."
- Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts
- "And thou art wedded to calamity.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "ROMEO.\nFather, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?"
- "What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,\nThat I yet know not?"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nToo familiar\nIs my dear son with such sour company."
- I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
- "ROMEO.\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nA gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,"
- "Not body’s death, but body’s banishment."
- "ROMEO.\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;"
- "For exile hath more terror in his look,"
- Much more than death. Do not say banishment.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHence from Verona art thou banished."
- "Be patient, for the world is broad and wide."
- "ROMEO.\nThere is no world without Verona walls,"
- "But purgatory, torture, hell itself."
- "Hence banished is banish’d from the world,"
- And world’s exile is death. Then banished
- "Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,"
- "Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,"
- And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!"
- "Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,"
- "Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,"
- And turn’d that black word death to banishment.
- "This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not."
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here"
- "Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,"
- "And little mouse, every unworthy thing,"
- "Live here in heaven and may look on her,"
- "But Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives"
- In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
- "On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,"
- "And steal immortal blessing from her lips,"
- "Who, even in pure and vestal modesty"
- "Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin."
- "But Romeo may not, he is banished."
- "This may flies do, when I from this must fly."
- They are free men but I am banished.
- And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
- "Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,"
- "No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,"
- But banished to kill me? Banished?
- "O Friar, the damned use that word in hell."
- "Howlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,"
- "Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,"
- "A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,"
- To mangle me with that word banished?
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,"
- "ROMEO.\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,"
- "Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,"
- "To comfort thee, though thou art banished."
- "ROMEO.\nYet banished? Hang up philosophy.\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,"
- "Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,"
- "It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, then I see that mad men have no ears."
- "ROMEO.\nHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate."
- "ROMEO.\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel."
- "Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,"
- "An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,"
- "Doting like me, and like me banished,"
- "Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,"
- "And fall upon the ground as I do now,"
- "Taking the measure of an unmade grave.\n\n [_Knocking within._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nArise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself."
- "ROMEO.\nNot I, unless the breath of heartsick groans"
- Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
- "[_Knocking._]"
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise"
- ",\nThou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up."
- "[_Knocking._]"
- Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s
- "will,\nWhat simpleness is this.—I come, I come."
- "[_Knocking._]"
- "Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?"
- NURSE.
- "[_Within."
- "_] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand."
- "I come from Lady Juliet.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWelcome then.\n\n Enter Nurse."
- "NURSE.\nO holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,"
- "Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThere on the ground, with his own tears made drunk."
- "NURSE.\nO, he is even in my mistress’ case."
- Just in her case! O woeful sympathy!
- "Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,"
- "Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering."
- "Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man."
- "For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand."
- "Why should you fall into so deep an O?\n\nROMEO.\nNurse."
- "NURSE.\nAh sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all."
- "ROMEO.\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?"
- "Doth not she think me an old murderer,"
- Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
- With blood remov’d but little from her own?
- Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
- My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?
- NURSE.
- "O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;"
- "And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,"
- "And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again."
- "ROMEO.\nAs if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,"
- "Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand"
- Murder’d her kinsman.
- "O, tell me, Friar, tell me,"
- In what vile part of this anatomy
- "Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack"
- "The hateful mansion.\n\n [_Drawing his sword._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold thy desperate hand."
- Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
- "Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote"
- "The unreasonable fury of a beast.\nUnseemly woman in a seeming man,"
- And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
- "Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,"
- I thought thy disposition better temper’d.
- Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
- "And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,"
- By doing damned hate upon thyself?
- "Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?"
- "Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet"
- In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
- "Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy"
- "wit,\nWhich, like a usurer, abound’st in all,"
- And usest none in that true use indeed
- "Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit."
- "Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,"
- Digressing from the valour of a man;
- "Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,"
- Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
- "Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,"
- "Misshapen in the conduct of them both,"
- "Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,"
- "Is set afire by thine own ignorance,"
- And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
- "What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,"
- For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
- "There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,"
- But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.
- "The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,"
- And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.
- A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
- Happiness courts thee in her best array;
- "But like a misshaped and sullen wench,"
- Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.
- "Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable."
- "Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,"
- "Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her."
- "But look thou stay not till the watch be set,"
- For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
- Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
- "To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,"
- "Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back"
- With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
- Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
- "Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,"
- "And bid her hasten all the house to bed,"
- "Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\nRomeo is coming."
- "NURSE.\nO Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night"
- "To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!"
- "My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come."
- "ROMEO.\nDo so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide."
- "NURSE.\nHere sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir."
- "Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "ROMEO.\nHow well my comfort is reviv’d by this."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGo hence, good night, and here stands all your state:"
- "Either be gone before the watch be set,"
- Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
- "Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,"
- And he shall signify from time to time
- Every good hap to you that chances here.
- Give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.
- "ROMEO.\nBut that a joy past joy calls out on me,"
- "It were a grief so brief to part with thee.\nFarewell."
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- SCENE IV. A Room in Capulet’s House.
- "Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris."
- "CAPULET.\nThings have fallen out, sir, so unluckily"
- That we have had no time to move our daughter.
- "Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,"
- "And so did I. Well, we were born to die."
- ’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.
- "I promise you, but for your company,"
- I would have been abed an hour ago.
- "PARIS.\nThese times of woe afford no tune to woo."
- "Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nI will, and know her mind early tomorrow;"
- Tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.
- "CAPULET.\nSir Paris, I will make a desperate tender"
- Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
- "In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not."
- "Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,"
- "Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,"
- "And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,"
- "But, soft, what day is this?\n\nPARIS.\nMonday, my lord."
- "CAPULET.\nMonday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,"
- "A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,"
- She shall be married to this noble earl.
- Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
- "We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,"
- "For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,"
- "It may be thought we held him carelessly,"
- "Being our kinsman, if we revel much."
- "Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,"
- And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
- "PARIS.\nMy lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow."
- "CAPULET.\nWell, get you gone. A Thursday be it then."
- "Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,"
- "Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day."
- "Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!"
- "Afore me, it is so very very late that we"
- May call it early by and by. Good night.
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- "SCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden."
- Enter Romeo and Juliet.
- "JULIET.\nWilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day."
- "It was the nightingale, and not the lark,"
- That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
- Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
- "Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
- "ROMEO.\nIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,"
- "No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks"
- Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
- "Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day"
- Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
- "I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
- "JULIET.\nYond light is not daylight, I know it, I."
- It is some meteor that the sun exhales
- To be to thee this night a torchbearer
- And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
- "Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone."
- "ROMEO.\nLet me be ta’en, let me be put to death,"
- "I am content, so thou wilt have it so."
- "I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,"
- ’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.
- Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
- The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
- I have more care to stay than will to go.
- "Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so."
- "How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk."
- It is not day.
- "JULIET.\nIt is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away."
- "It is the lark that sings so out of tune,"
- Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
- Some say the lark makes sweet division;
- "This doth not so, for she divideth us."
- Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.
- "O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,"
- "Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,"
- Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
- "O now be gone, more light and light it grows."
- "ROMEO.\nMore light and light, more dark and dark our woes."
- "Enter Nurse.\n\nNURSE.\nMadam.\n\nJULIET.\nNurse?"
- "NURSE.\nYour lady mother is coming to your chamber."
- "The day is broke, be wary, look about."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out."
- "ROMEO.\nFarewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend."
- "[_Descends._]"
- JULIET.
- "Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,"
- "I must hear from thee every day in the hour,"
- For in a minute there are many days.
- "O, by this count I shall be much in years"
- Ere I again behold my Romeo.
- "ROMEO.\nFarewell!\nI will omit no opportunity"
- "That may convey my greetings, love, to thee."
- "JULIET.\nO thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?"
- "ROMEO.\nI doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve"
- For sweet discourses in our time to come.
- "JULIET.\nO God! I have an ill-divining soul!"
- "Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,"
- As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
- "Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd trust me, love, in my eye so do you."
- "Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu."
- "[_Exit below._]"
- "JULIET.\nO Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,"
- "If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him"
- "That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;"
- "For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long"
- But send him back.
- LADY CAPULET.
- "[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?"
- "JULIET.\nWho is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?"
- "Is she not down so late, or up so early?"
- What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?
- "Enter Lady Capulet.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWhy, how now, Juliet?"
- "JULIET.\nMadam, I am not well."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nEvermore weeping for your cousin’s death?"
- "What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?"
- "And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live."
- "Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,"
- But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
- "JULIET.\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friend"
- Which you weep for.
- "JULIET.\nFeeling so the loss,\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend."
- LADY CAPULET.
- "Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death"
- As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.
- "JULIET.\nWhat villain, madam?\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nThat same villain Romeo."
- "JULIET.\nVillain and he be many miles asunder."
- "God pardon him. I do, with all my heart."
- And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThat is because the traitor murderer lives."
- "JULIET.\nAy madam, from the reach of these my hands."
- Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not."
- "Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,"
- "Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,"
- Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
- "That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:"
- And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
- "JULIET.\nIndeed I never shall be satisfied"
- With Romeo till I behold him—dead—
- Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.
- "Madam, if you could find out but a man"
- "To bear a poison, I would temper it,"
- "That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,"
- "Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors"
- "To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,"
- To wreak the love I bore my cousin
- Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.
- LADY CAPULET.
- "Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man."
- "But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl."
- "JULIET.\nAnd joy comes well in such a needy time."
- "What are they, I beseech your ladyship?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child;"
- "One who to put thee from thy heaviness,"
- "Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,"
- "That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for."
- "JULIET.\nMadam, in happy time, what day is that?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn"
- "The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,"
- "The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,"
- Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
- "JULIET.\nNow by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,"
- He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
- "I wonder at this haste, that I must wed"
- Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
- "I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,"
- "I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear"
- "It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,"
- Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHere comes your father, tell him so yourself,"
- "And see how he will take it at your hands.\n\n Enter Capulet and Nurse."
- "CAPULET.\nWhen the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;"
- "But for the sunset of my brother’s son\nIt rains downright."
- "How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?"
- Evermore showering? In one little body
- "Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind."
- "For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,"
- "Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,"
- "Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,"
- "Who raging with thy tears and they with them,"
- Without a sudden calm will overset
- "Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?"
- Have you deliver’d to her our decree?
- LADY CAPULET.
- "Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks."
- I would the fool were married to her grave.
- "CAPULET.\nSoft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife."
- "How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?"
- "Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,"
- "Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought"
- So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
- "JULIET.\nNot proud you have, but thankful that you have."
- Proud can I never be of what I hate;
- But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
- CAPULET.
- "How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?"
- "Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;"
- "And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,"
- "Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,"
- But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next
- "To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,"
- Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
- "Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!"
- You tallow-face!
- "LADY CAPULET.\nFie, fie! What, are you mad?"
- "JULIET.\nGood father, I beseech you on my knees,"
- Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
- "CAPULET.\nHang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!"
- "I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,"
- Or never after look me in the face.
- "Speak not, reply not, do not answer me."
- "My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest"
- That God had lent us but this only child;
- "But now I see this one is one too much,"
- And that we have a curse in having her.
- "Out on her, hilding."
- "NURSE.\nGod in heaven bless her."
- "You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so."
- "CAPULET.\nAnd why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,"
- "Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go."
- "NURSE.\nI speak no treason.\n\nCAPULET.\nO God ye good-en!"
- "NURSE.\nMay not one speak?"
- "CAPULET.\nPeace, you mumbling fool!"
- "Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,"
- "For here we need it not.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nYou are too hot."
- "CAPULET.\nGod’s bread, it makes me mad!"
- "Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,"
- "Alone, in company, still my care hath been"
- "To have her match’d, and having now provided"
- "A gentleman of noble parentage,"
- "Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,"
- "Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,"
- "Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,"
- "And then to have a wretched puling fool,"
- "A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,"
- "To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,"
- "I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’"
- "But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you."
- "Graze where you will, you shall not house with me."
- "Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to"
- "jest.\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise."
- "And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;"
- "And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets"
- ",\nFor by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,"
- Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
- "Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be"
- "forsworn.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nIs there no pity sitting in the clouds,"
- That sees into the bottom of my grief?
- "O sweet my mother, cast me not away,"
- "Delay this marriage for a month, a week,"
- "Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed"
- In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
- LADY CAPULET.
- "Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word."
- "Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nO God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?"
- "My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven."
- "How shall that faith return again to earth,"
- Unless that husband send it me from heaven
- "By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me."
- "Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems"
- Upon so soft a subject as myself.
- What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
- "Some comfort, Nurse."
- "NURSE.\nFaith, here it is."
- Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing
- That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.
- "Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth."
- "Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,"
- I think it best you married with the County.
- "O, he’s a lovely gentleman."
- "Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,"
- "Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye"
- "As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,"
- "I think you are happy in this second match,"
- "For it excels your first: or if it did not,"
- "Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,"
- As living here and you no use of him.
- "JULIET.\nSpeakest thou from thy heart?"
- "NURSE.\nAnd from my soul too,\nOr else beshrew them both."
- "JULIET.\nAmen.\n\nNURSE.\nWhat?"
- "JULIET.\nWell, thou hast comforted me marvellous much."
- "Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,"
- "Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,"
- To make confession and to be absolv’d.
- "NURSE.\nMarry, I will; and this is wisely done."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nAncient damnation! O most wicked fiend!"
- "Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,"
- Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
- Which she hath prais’d him with above compare
- "So many thousand times? Go, counsellor."
- Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
- I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.
- "If all else fail, myself have power to die."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "ACT IV\n\nSCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell."
- Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nOn Thursday, sir? The time is very short."
- "PARIS.\nMy father Capulet will have it so;"
- And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nYou say you do not know the lady’s mind."
- Uneven is the course; I like it not.
- "PARIS.\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,"
- And therefore have I little talk’d of love;
- For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
- "Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous"
- That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
- "And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,"
- "To stop the inundation of her tears,"
- "Which, too much minded by herself alone,"
- May be put from her by society.
- Now do you know the reason of this haste.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "[_Aside."
- "_] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—"
- "Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\n\n Enter Juliet."
- "PARIS.\nHappily met, my lady and my wife!"
- "JULIET.\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife."
- "PARIS.\nThat may be, must be, love, on Thursday next."
- "JULIET.\nWhat must be shall be."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThat’s a certain text."
- "PARIS.\nCome you to make confession to this father?"
- "JULIET.\nTo answer that, I should confess to you."
- "PARIS.\nDo not deny to him that you love me."
- "JULIET.\nI will confess to you that I love him."
- "PARIS.\nSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me."
- "JULIET.\nIf I do so, it will be of more price,"
- Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
- "PARIS.\nPoor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears."
- "JULIET.\nThe tears have got small victory by that;"
- For it was bad enough before their spite.
- "PARIS.\nThou wrong’st it more than tears with that report."
- "JULIET.\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,"
- "And what I spake, I spake it to my face."
- PARIS.
- "Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it."
- "JULIET.\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own."
- "Are you at leisure, holy father, now,"
- Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—"
- "My lord, we must entreat the time alone."
- "PARIS.\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!—"
- "Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,"
- "Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nO shut the door, and when thou hast done so,"
- "Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief;"
- It strains me past the compass of my wits.
- "I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,"
- On Thursday next be married to this County.
- "JULIET.\nTell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,"
- Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
- "If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,"
- "Do thou but call my resolution wise,"
- And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
- "God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;"
- "And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,"
- "Shall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt"
- "Turn to another, this shall slay them both."
- "Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,"
- "Give me some present counsel, or behold"
- ’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
- "Shall play the empire, arbitrating that"
- Which the commission of thy years and art
- Could to no issue of true honour bring.
- "Be not so long to speak. I long to die,"
- If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,"
- "Which craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent."
- "If, rather than to marry County Paris"
- "Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,"
- Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
- "A thing like death to chide away this shame,"
- That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.
- "And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy."
- "JULIET.\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,"
- "From off the battlements of yonder tower,"
- "Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk"
- Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;
- "Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,"
- "O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,"
- With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
- "Or bid me go into a new-made grave,"
- And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
- "Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,"
- "And I will do it without fear or doubt,"
- To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold then. Go home, be merry, give consent"
- "To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;\nTomorrow night look that thou lie alone,"
- Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
- "Take thou this vial, being then in bed,"
- "And this distilled liquor drink thou off,"
- When presently through all thy veins shall run
- A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
- "Shall keep his native progress, but surcease."
- "No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,"
- The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
- "To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,"
- Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
- "Each part depriv’d of supple government,"
- Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.
- And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death
- "Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,"
- And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
- Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
- "To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead."
- "Then as the manner of our country is,"
- "In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,"
- Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
- Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
- "In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,"
- "Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,"
- "And hither shall he come, and he and I"
- "Will watch thy waking, and that very night"
- Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
- "And this shall free thee from this present shame,"
- If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
- Abate thy valour in the acting it.
- "JULIET.\nGive me, give me! O tell not me of fear!"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous"
- In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed
- "To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord."
- "JULIET.\nLove give me strength, and strength shall help afford."
- "Farewell, dear father.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- SCENE II. Hall in Capulet’s House.
- "Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants."
- "CAPULET.\nSo many guests invite as here are writ."
- "[_Exit first Servant._]"
- "Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks."
- SECOND SERVANT.
- "You shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can"
- "lick their\nfingers.\n\nCAPULET.\nHow canst thou try them so?"
- SECOND SERVANT.
- "Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;"
- therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
- "CAPULET.\nGo, begone.\n\n [_Exit second Servant._]"
- We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
- "What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?"
- "NURSE.\nAy, forsooth."
- "CAPULET.\nWell, he may chance to do some good on her."
- A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.
- "Enter Juliet.\n\nNURSE.\nSee where she comes from shrift with merry look."
- CAPULET.
- "How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?"
- "JULIET.\nWhere I have learnt me to repent the sin"
- Of disobedient opposition
- To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
- "By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,"
- "To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you."
- Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.
- "CAPULET.\nSend for the County, go tell him of this."
- I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
- "JULIET.\nI met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,"
- "And gave him what becomed love I might,"
- Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.
- CAPULET.
- "Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up."
- This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.
- "Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither."
- "Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,"
- All our whole city is much bound to him.
- "JULIET.\nNurse, will you go with me into my closet,"
- To help me sort such needful ornaments
- As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
- "LADY CAPULET.\nNo, not till Thursday. There is time enough."
- CAPULET.
- "Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow."
- "[_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWe shall be short in our provision,"
- ’Tis now near night.
- "CAPULET.\nTush, I will stir about,"
- "And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife."
- "Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her."
- "I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone."
- "I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho"
- "!—\nThey are all forth: well, I will walk myself"
- "To County Paris, to prepare him up"
- Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light
- Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Juliet’s Chamber."
- Enter Juliet and Nurse.
- "JULIET.\nAy, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,"
- I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;
- For I have need of many orisons
- "To move the heavens to smile upon my state,"
- "Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin."
- Enter Lady Capulet.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhat, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?"
- "JULIET.\nNo, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries"
- As are behoveful for our state tomorrow.
- "So please you, let me now be left alone,"
- "And let the nurse this night sit up with you,"
- "For I am sure you have your hands full all\nIn this so sudden business."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nGood night."
- "Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need."
- "[_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]"
- "JULIET.\nFarewell. God knows when we shall meet again."
- I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
- That almost freezes up the heat of life.
- I’ll call them back again to comfort me.
- Nurse!—What should she do here?
- "My dismal scene I needs must act alone.\nCome, vial."
- What if this mixture do not work at all?
- Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
- "No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there."
- "[_Laying down her dagger._]"
- "What if it be a poison, which the Friar"
- "Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,"
- "Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,"
- Because he married me before to Romeo?
- "I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,"
- For he hath still been tried a holy man.
- "How if, when I am laid into the tomb,"
- I wake before the time that Romeo
- Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!
- "Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,"
- "To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,"
- And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
- "Or, if I live, is it not very like,"
- "The horrible conceit of death and night,"
- "Together with the terror of the place,"
- "As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,"
- Where for this many hundred years the bones
- "Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,"
- "Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,"
- "Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,"
- At some hours in the night spirits resort—
- "Alack, alack, is it not like that I,"
- "So early waking, what with loathsome smells,"
- "And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,"
- "That living mortals, hearing them, run mad."
- "O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,"
- "Environed with all these hideous fears,"
- And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
- And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
- "And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,"
- "As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?"
- "O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost"
- Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
- "Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!"
- "Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee."
- "[_Throws herself on the bed._]"
- "SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse."
- "NURSE.\nThey call for dates and quinces in the pastry."
- Enter Capulet.
- CAPULET.
- "Come, stir, stir, stir!"
- "The second cock hath crow’d,"
- "The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock"
- ".\nLook to the bak’d meats, good Angelica;"
- Spare not for cost.
- "NURSE.\nGo, you cot-quean, go,"
- "Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow"
- For this night’s watching.
- CAPULET.
- "No, not a whit. What!"
- I have watch’d ere now
- "All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nAy, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;"
- But I will watch you from such watching now.
- "[_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]"
- "CAPULET.\nA jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!"
- "Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets."
- "Now, fellow, what’s there?"
- "FIRST SERVANT.\nThings for the cook, sir; but I know not what."
- "CAPULET.\nMake haste, make haste.\n\n [_Exit First Servant._]"
- "—Sirrah, fetch drier logs."
- "Call Peter, he will show thee where they are."
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nI have a head, sir, that will find out logs"
- "And never trouble Peter for the matter.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "CAPULET.\nMass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha."
- "Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day."
- "The County will be here with music straight,"
- For so he said he would. I hear him near.
- "[_Play music._]"
- "Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nurse, I say!"
- Re-enter Nurse.
- "Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up."
- "I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,"
- Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already.
- "Make haste I say.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "SCENE V. Juliet’s Chamber; Juliet on the bed.\n\n Enter Nurse."
- NURSE.
- "Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she."
- "Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed"
- "!\nWhy, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!"
- "What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now."
- "Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,"
- The County Paris hath set up his rest
- That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
- Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep!
- "I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!"
- "Ay, let the County take you in your bed,"
- "He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?"
- "What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?"
- I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!
- "Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!"
- "O, well-a-day that ever I was born."
- "Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady!"
- "Enter Lady Capulet.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWhat noise is here?"
- "NURSE.\nO lamentable day!\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWhat is the matter?"
- "NURSE.\nLook, look! O heavy day!"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO me, O me! My child, my only life."
- "Revive, look up, or I will die with thee."
- "Help, help! Call help.\n\n Enter Capulet."
- "CAPULET.\nFor shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come."
- NURSE.
- "She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead"
- ; alack the day!
- LADY CAPULET.
- "Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead,"
- she’s dead!
- CAPULET.
- "Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,"
- Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.
- Life and these lips have long been separated.
- Death lies on her like an untimely frost
- Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
- "NURSE.\nO lamentable day!\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nO woful time!"
- CAPULET.
- "Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,"
- Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
- Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nCome, is the bride ready to go to church?"
- "CAPULET.\nReady to go, but never to return."
- "O son, the night before thy wedding day"
- "Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,"
- "Flower as she was, deflowered by him."
- "Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;"
- My daughter he hath wedded. I will die.
- "And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s."
- "PARIS.\nHave I thought long to see this morning’s face,"
- And doth it give me such a sight as this?
- "LADY CAPULET.\nAccurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day."
- "Most miserable hour that e’er time saw\nIn lasting labour of his pilgrimage."
- "But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,"
- "But one thing to rejoice and solace in,"
- And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.
- NURSE.
- O woe!
- "O woeful, woeful, woeful day."
- "Most lamentable day, most woeful day"
- "That ever, ever, I did yet behold!"
- "O day, O day, O day, O hateful day."
- Never was seen so black a day as this.
- "O woeful day, O woeful day."
- "PARIS.\nBeguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain."
- "Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,"
- "By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown."
- "O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!"
- CAPULET.
- "Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d."
- "Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now"
- "To murder, murder our solemnity?"
- "O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,"
- "Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,"
- And with my child my joys are buried.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nPeace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not"
- In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
- "Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,"
- And all the better is it for the maid.
- "Your part in her you could not keep from death,"
- But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
- "The most you sought was her promotion,"
- "For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,"
- "And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d"
- "Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?"
- "O, in this love, you love your child so ill"
- "That you run mad, seeing that she is well."
- "She’s not well married that lives married long,"
- But she’s best married that dies married young.
- "Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary"
- "On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,"
- And in her best array bear her to church;
- "For though fond nature bids us all lament,"
- Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.
- "CAPULET.\nAll things that we ordained festival\nTurn from their office to black funeral:"
- "Our instruments to melancholy bells,\nOur wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;"
- Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
- "Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,"
- And all things change them to the contrary.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,"
- "And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare"
- To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
- The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
- Move them no more by crossing their high will.
- "[_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]"
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nFaith, we may put up our pipes and be gone."
- "NURSE.\nHonest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,"
- For well you know this is a pitiful case.
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nAy, by my troth, the case may be amended."
- "[_Exit Nurse._]\n\n Enter Peter."
- PETER.
- "Musicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘"
- "Heart’s ease’, O, and you"
- "will have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’"
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nWhy ‘Heart’s ease’?"
- PETER.
- "O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’."
- "O play\nme some merry dump to comfort me."
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nNot a dump we, ’tis no time to play now."
- "PETER.\nYou will not then?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\nNo."
- "PETER.\nI will then give it you soundly."
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nWhat will you give us?"
- PETER.
- "No money, on my faith, but the gleek!"
- I will give you the minstrel.
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nThen will I give you the serving-creature."
- PETER.
- Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate.
- I will
- carry no crotchets.
- "I’ll re you, I’ll fa you."
- Do you note me?
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nAnd you re us and fa us, you note us."
- "SECOND MUSICIAN.\nPray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit."
- PETER.
- Then have at you with my wit.
- "I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and"
- put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
- "‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,"
- "And doleful dumps the mind oppress,"
- Then music with her silver sound’—
- Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’?
- "What say you,\nSimon Catling?"
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nMarry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound."
- "PETER.\nPrates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?"
- "SECOND MUSICIAN.\nI say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver."
- "PETER.\nPrates too! What say you, James Soundpost?"
- "THIRD MUSICIAN.\nFaith, I know not what to say."
- PETER.
- "O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer."
- I will say for you. It is
- "‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for\nsounding."
- ‘Then music with her silver sound
- "With speedy help doth lend redress.’\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nWhat a pestilent knave is this same!"
- SECOND MUSICIAN.
- "Hang him, Jack."
- "Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners,"
- "and stay\ndinner.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "ACT V\n\nSCENE I. Mantua. A Street.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "ROMEO.\nIf I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,"
- My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
- My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;
- And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
- Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
- "I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—"
- "Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—"
- "And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,"
- "That I reviv’d, and was an emperor."
- "Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,"
- "When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.\n\n Enter Balthasar."
- "News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?"
- Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
- How doth my lady? Is my father well?
- How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
- For nothing can be ill if she be well.
- "BALTHASAR.\nThen she is well, and nothing can be ill."
- "Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,"
- And her immortal part with angels lives.
- "I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,"
- And presently took post to tell it you.
- "O pardon me for bringing these ill news,"
- "Since you did leave it for my office, sir."
- "ROMEO.\nIs it even so? Then I defy you, stars!"
- "Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,"
- And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
- "BALTHASAR.\nI do beseech you sir, have patience."
- "Your looks are pale and wild, and do import\nSome misadventure."
- "ROMEO.\nTush, thou art deceiv’d."
- "Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do."
- Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
- "BALTHASAR.\nNo, my good lord."
- "ROMEO.\nNo matter. Get thee gone,"
- And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.
- "[_Exit Balthasar._]"
- "Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight."
- Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift
- To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
- "I do remember an apothecary,—"
- "And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted"
- "In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,"
- "Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,"
- Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
- "And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,"
- "An alligator stuff’d, and other skins"
- Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
- "A beggarly account of empty boxes,"
- "Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,"
- "Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses"
- "Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show."
- "Noting this penury, to myself I said,"
- "And if a man did need a poison now,"
- "Whose sale is present death in Mantua,"
- Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
- "O, this same thought did but forerun my need,"
- And this same needy man must sell it me.
- "As I remember, this should be the house."
- "Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut."
- "What, ho! Apothecary!\n\n Enter Apothecary.\n\nAPOTHECARY.\nWho calls so loud?"
- "ROMEO.\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor."
- "Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have"
- "A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear"
- "As will disperse itself through all the veins,"
- "That the life-weary taker may fall dead,"
- And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
- As violently as hasty powder fir’d
- Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.
- "APOTHECARY.\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law"
- Is death to any he that utters them.
- "ROMEO.\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,"
- "And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,"
- "Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,"
- Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
- "The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;"
- The world affords no law to make thee rich;
- "Then be not poor, but break it and take this."
- "APOTHECARY.\nMy poverty, but not my will consents."
- "ROMEO.\nI pay thy poverty, and not thy will."
- "APOTHECARY.\nPut this in any liquid thing you will"
- "And drink it off; and, if you had the strength"
- "Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight."
- "ROMEO.\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,"
- Doing more murder in this loathsome world
- Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
- "I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none."
- "Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh."
- "Come, cordial and not poison, go with me"
- "To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Friar Lawrence’s Cell."
- "Enter Friar John.\n\nFRIAR JOHN.\nHoly Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!"
- Enter Friar Lawrence.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThis same should be the voice of Friar John."
- Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
- "Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter."
- "FRIAR JOHN.\nGoing to find a barefoot brother out,"
- "One of our order, to associate me,"
- "Here in this city visiting the sick,"
- "And finding him, the searchers of the town,"
- Suspecting that we both were in a house
- "Where the infectious pestilence did reign,"
- "Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,"
- So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWho bare my letter then to Romeo?"
- "FRIAR JOHN.\nI could not send it,—here it is again,—"
- "Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,\nSo fearful were they of infection."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nUnhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,"
- "The letter was not nice, but full of charge,"
- "Of dear import, and the neglecting it"
- "May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,"
- "Get me an iron crow and bring it straight\nUnto my cell."
- "FRIAR JOHN.\nBrother, I’ll go and bring it thee."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNow must I to the monument alone."
- Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
- She will beshrew me much that Romeo
- "Hath had no notice of these accidents;\nBut I will write again to Mantua,"
- And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
- "Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb"
- ".\n\n [_Exit._]"
- SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.
- "Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch."
- "PARIS.\nGive me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof."
- "Yet put it out, for I would not be seen."
- "Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,"
- Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
- "So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,"
- "Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,"
- "But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,"
- As signal that thou hear’st something approach.
- "Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go."
- "PAGE.\n[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone"
- "Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.\n\n [_Retires._]"
- "PARIS.\nSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew."
- "O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,"
- "Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,"
- "Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans."
- "The obsequies that I for thee will keep,"
- Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
- "[_The Page whistles._]"
- The boy gives warning something doth approach.
- "What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,"
- To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
- "What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile."
- "[_Retires._]"
- "Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c."
- "ROMEO.\nGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron."
- "Hold, take this letter; early in the morning"
- See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
- "Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,"
- "Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof"
- And do not interrupt me in my course.
- Why I descend into this bed of death
- "Is partly to behold my lady’s face,"
- But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
- "A precious ring, a ring that I must use"
- "In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone."
- But if thou jealous dost return to pry
- "In what I further shall intend to do,"
- "By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,"
- And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
- The time and my intents are savage-wild;
- More fierce and more inexorable far
- Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
- "BALTHASAR.\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you."
- "ROMEO.\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that."
- "Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow."
- "BALTHASAR.\nFor all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout."
- "His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt."
- "[_Retires_]"
- "ROMEO.\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,"
- "Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,"
- "Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,"
- "[_Breaking open the door of the monument._]"
- "And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food."
- "PARIS.\nThis is that banish’d haughty Montague"
- "That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,"
- "It is supposed, the fair creature died,—"
- And here is come to do some villanous shame
- To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
- "[_Advances._]"
- "Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague."
- Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?
- "Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee."
- "Obey, and go with me, for thou must die."
- "ROMEO.\nI must indeed; and therefore came I hither."
- "Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man."
- Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
- "Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,"
- Put not another sin upon my head
- By urging me to fury. O be gone.
- By heaven I love thee better than myself;
- For I come hither arm’d against myself.
- "Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,"
- A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.
- "PARIS.\nI do defy thy conjuration,"
- And apprehend thee for a felon here.
- "ROMEO.\nWilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!"
- "[_They fight._]"
- "PAGE.\nO lord, they fight! I will go call the watch."
- "[_Exit._]"
- PARIS.
- "O, I am slain! [_Falls."
- "_] If thou be merciful,"
- "Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.\n\n [_Dies._]"
- "ROMEO.\nIn faith, I will. Let me peruse this face."
- "Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!"
- "What said my man, when my betossed soul"
- Did not attend him as we rode? I think
- He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
- Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
- "Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,"
- "To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,"
- One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.
- I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
- "A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,"
- "For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes"
- This vault a feasting presence full of light.
- "Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d."
- "[_Laying Paris in the monument._]"
- How oft when men are at the point of death
- Have they been merry! Which their keepers call
- "A lightning before death. O, how may I"
- "Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,"
- "Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,"
- Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
- Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet
- "Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,"
- And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
- "Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?"
- "O, what more favour can I do to thee"
- Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
- To sunder his that was thine enemy?
- "Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,"
- Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
- That unsubstantial death is amorous;
- And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
- Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
- "For fear of that I still will stay with thee,"
- And never from this palace of dim night
- "Depart again. Here, here will I remain"
- "With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here"
- Will I set up my everlasting rest;
- And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
- "From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last."
- "Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you"
- "The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss"
- A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
- "Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide."
- "Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on"
- The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.
- "Here’s to my love! [_Drinks."
- "_] O true apothecary!"
- Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
- "[_Dies._]"
- "Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a"
- "lantern, crow, and spade."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSaint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight"
- Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?
- "Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?"
- BALTHASAR.
- "Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,"
- What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
- "To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,"
- It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
- BALTHASAR.
- "It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,"
- "One that you love.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWho is it?\n\nBALTHASAR.\nRomeo."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHow long hath he been there?"
- "BALTHASAR.\nFull half an hour."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGo with me to the vault."
- "BALTHASAR.\nI dare not, sir;"
- "My master knows not but I am gone hence,"
- And fearfully did menace me with death
- If I did stay to look on his intents.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me."
- "O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing."
- "BALTHASAR.\nAs I did sleep under this yew tree here,"
- "I dreamt my master and another fought,"
- And that my master slew him.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo! [_Advances._]"
- "Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains"
- The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
- What mean these masterless and gory swords
- To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?
- "[_Enters the monument._]"
- "Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?"
- And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour
- "Is guilty of this lamentable chance?\nThe lady stirs."
- "[_Juliet wakes and stirs._]"
- "JULIET.\nO comfortable Friar, where is my lord?"
- "I do remember well where I should be,"
- And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
- "[_Noise within._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest"
- "Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep."
- A greater power than we can contradict
- "Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away."
- Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
- "And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee"
- Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
- "Stay not to question, for the watch is coming."
- "Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay."
- "JULIET.\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away."
- "[_Exit Friar Lawrence._]"
- What’s here?
- A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
- "Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end."
- "O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop"
- To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
- "Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,"
- To make me die with a restorative.
- "[_Kisses him._]\n\nThy lips are warm!"
- "FIRST WATCH.\n[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?"
- JULIET.
- "Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger."
- "[_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]"
- "This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and"
- let me die.
- "[_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]"
- Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.
- "PAGE.\nThis is the place. There, where the torch doth burn."
- "FIRST WATCH.\nThe ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard."
- "Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach."
- "[_Exeunt some of the Watch._]"
- "Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,"
- "And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,"
- Who here hath lain this two days buried.
- Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.
- "Raise up the Montagues, some others search."
- "[_Exeunt others of the Watch._]"
- "We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,"
- But the true ground of all these piteous woes
- We cannot without circumstance descry.
- Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.
- SECOND WATCH.
- Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.
- "FIRST WATCH.\nHold him in safety till the Prince come hither."
- Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.
- THIRD WATCH.
- "Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps."
- We took this mattock and this spade from him
- As he was coming from this churchyard side.
- "FIRST WATCH.\nA great suspicion. Stay the Friar too."
- Enter the Prince and Attendants.
- "PRINCE.\nWhat misadventure is so early up,"
- That calls our person from our morning’s rest?
- "Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others."
- "CAPULET.\nWhat should it be that they so shriek abroad?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO the people in the street cry Romeo,"
- "Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run"
- With open outcry toward our monument.
- "PRINCE.\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?"
- "FIRST WATCH.\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,"
- "And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,"
- Warm and new kill’d.
- "PRINCE.\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes."
- FIRST WATCH.
- "Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,"
- "With instruments upon them fit to open\nThese dead men’s tombs."
- "CAPULET.\nO heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!"
- "This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house"
- "Is empty on the back of Montague,"
- And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO me! This sight of death is as a bell"
- That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
- Enter Montague and others.
- "PRINCE.\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up,"
- To see thy son and heir more early down.
- "MONTAGUE.\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight."
- Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
- What further woe conspires against mine age?
- "PRINCE.\nLook, and thou shalt see."
- "MONTAGUE.\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,"
- To press before thy father to a grave?
- "PRINCE.\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,"
- "Till we can clear these ambiguities,"
- "And know their spring, their head, their true descent,"
- "And then will I be general of your woes,"
- "And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,"
- And let mischance be slave to patience.
- Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI am the greatest, able to do least,"
- "Yet most suspected, as the time and place"
- "Doth make against me, of this direful murder."
- "And here I stand, both to impeach and purge"
- Myself condemned and myself excus’d.
- "PRINCE.\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath"
- Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
- "Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,"
- "And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife."
- I married them; and their stol’n marriage day
- "Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death"
- Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
- "For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d."
- "You, to remove that siege of grief from her,"
- "Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce"
- "To County Paris. Then comes she to me,"
- "And with wild looks, bid me devise some means"
- "To rid her from this second marriage,"
- Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
- "Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,"
- "A sleeping potion, which so took effect"
- "As I intended, for it wrought on her"
- The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
- That he should hither come as this dire night
- "To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,"
- Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
- "But he which bore my letter, Friar John,"
- Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight
- Return’d my letter back. Then all alone
- At the prefixed hour of her waking
- "Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,"
- Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
- Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
- "But when I came, some minute ere the time"
- "Of her awaking, here untimely lay"
- The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
- She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
- And bear this work of heaven with patience.
- But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
- "And she, too desperate, would not go with me,"
- "But, as it seems, did violence on herself."
- All this I know; and to the marriage
- Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this
- "Miscarried by my fault, let my old life"
- "Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,"
- Unto the rigour of severest law.
- "PRINCE.\nWe still have known thee for a holy man."
- Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
- "BALTHASAR.\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,"
- And then in post he came from Mantua
- "To this same place, to this same monument."
- "This letter he early bid me give his father,"
- "And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,"
- "If I departed not, and left him there."
- "PRINCE.\nGive me the letter, I will look on it."
- Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
- "Sirrah, what made your master in this place?"
- "PAGE.\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,"
- "And bid me stand aloof, and so I did."
- "Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,"
- "And by and by my master drew on him,"
- And then I ran away to call the watch.
- "PRINCE.\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,"
- "Their course of love, the tidings of her death."
- And here he writes that he did buy a poison
- "Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal"
- "Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet."
- "Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,"
- "See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,"
- That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
- "And I, for winking at your discords too,"
- Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
- "CAPULET.\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand."
- "This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\nCan I demand."
- "MONTAGUE.\nBut I can give thee more,"
- "For I will raise her statue in pure gold,"
- "That whiles Verona by that name is known,"
- There shall no figure at such rate be set
- As that of true and faithful Juliet.
- "CAPULET.\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,"
- Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
- "PRINCE.\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;"
- The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
- "Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things."
- "Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,"
- For never was a story of more woe
- "Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"

- Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
- widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
- increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
- freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
- array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
- "($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt"
- status with the IRS.
- The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
- charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
- States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
- "considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up"
- with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
- where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
- DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
- state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
- While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
- "have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition"
- against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
- approach us with offers to donate.
- "International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make"

- methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
- "ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To"
- "donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate"
- Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
- Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
- Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
- "freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and"
- "distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support."
- Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
- "editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in"
- the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
- "Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition."
- Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
- "facility: www.gutenberg.org"
- "This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,"
- including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
- "Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to"
- subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
