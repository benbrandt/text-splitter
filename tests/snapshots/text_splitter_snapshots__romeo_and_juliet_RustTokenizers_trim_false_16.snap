- "SAMPSON.\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n"
- "I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\n"
- "Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nI strike quickly, being moved.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\n"
- "To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, "
- "if thou\nart moved, thou runn’st away.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand.\n"
- "I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\n"
- "That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n"
- "True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to\n"
- "the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and\n"
- "thrust his maids to the wall.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n"
- "’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought "
- "with the\n"
- "men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nThe heads of the maids?\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n"
- "Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in "
- "what sense\nthou wilt.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n"
- "Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I"
- " am a\npretty piece of flesh.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\n"
- "’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst "
- "been poor John.\nDraw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.\n\n"
- " Enter Abram and Balthasar.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nHow? Turn thy back and run?\n\nSAMPSON.\nFear me not.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\n"
- "I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list"
- ".\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n"
- "Nay, as they dare. "
- "I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to\n"
- "them if they bear it.\n\n"
- "ABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\n\n"
- "ABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nIs the law of our side if I say ay?\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nNo.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n"
- "No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I "
- "bite my thumb, sir.\n\nGREGORY.\nDo you quarrel, sir?\n\n"
- "ABRAM.\nQuarrel, sir? No, sir.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n"
- "But if you do, sir, I am for you. "
- "I serve as good a man as you.\n\nABRAM.\nNo better.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nWell, sir.\n\n Enter Benvolio.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\n"
- "Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nYes, better, sir.\n\nABRAM.\nYou lie.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.\n\n"
- " [_They fight._]\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\n"
- "Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.\n\n"
- " [_Beats down their swords._]\n\n Enter Tybalt.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\n"
- "Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nI do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,\n"
- "Or manage it to part these men with me.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\n"
- "As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\n"
- "Have at thee, coward.\n\n [_They fight._]\n\n"
- " Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.\n\n"
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\n"
- "Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\n\n"
- " Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\n"
- "A crutch, a crutch! "
- "Why call you for a sword?\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\n"
- "And flourishes his blade in spite of me.\n\n"
- " Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nThou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.\n\n"
- "LADY MONTAGUE.\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\n\n"
- " Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\n"
- "Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—\n"
- "Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,\n"
- "That quench the fire of your pernicious rage\n"
- "With purple fountains issuing from your veins,\n"
- "On pain of torture, from those bloody hands\n"
- "Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\n"
- "And hear the sentence of your moved prince.\n"
- "Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\n"
- "By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\n"
- "Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\n"
- "And made Verona’s ancient citizens\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\n"
- "To wield old partisans, in hands as old,\n"
- "Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\n"
- "If ever you disturb our streets again,\n"
- "Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\n"
- "For this time all the rest depart away:\n"
- "You, Capulet, shall go along with me,\n"
- "And Montague, come you this afternoon,\n"
- "To know our farther pleasure in this case,\n"
- "To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\n"
- "Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\n"
- " Citizens and Servants._]\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\n"
- "Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nHere were the servants of your adversary\n"
- "And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\n"
- "I drew to part them, in the instant came\n"
- "The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\n"
- "Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\n"
- "He swung about his head, and cut the winds,\n"
- "Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\n"
- "While we were interchanging thrusts and blows\n"
- "Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\n"
- "Till the Prince came, who parted either part.\n\n"
- "LADY MONTAGUE.\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\n"
- "Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\n"
- "Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,\n"
- "A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\n"
- "Where underneath the grove of sycamore\n"
- "That westward rooteth from this city side,\n"
- "So early walking did I see your son.\n"
- "Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,\n"
- "And stole into the covert of the wood.\n"
- "I, measuring his affections by my own,\n"
- "Which then most sought where most might not be found,\n"
- "Being one too many by my weary self,\n"
- "Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\n"
- "And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\n"
- "With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\n"
- "Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\n"
- "But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\n"
- "Should in the farthest east begin to draw\n"
- "The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\n"
- "Away from light steals home my heavy son,\n"
- "And private in his chamber pens himself,\n"
- "Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\n"
- "Black and portentous must this humour prove,\n"
- "Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\n"
- "But he, his own affections’ counsellor,\n"
- "Is to himself—I will not say how true—\n"
- "But to himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\n"
- "As is the bud bit with an envious worm\n"
- "Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\n"
- "Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\n"
- "Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\n"
- "We would as willingly give cure as know.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\n"
- "I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\n"
- "To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGood morrow, cousin.\n\nROMEO.\nIs the day so young?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nBut new struck nine.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\n"
- "Was that my father that went hence so fast?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nIn love?\n\nROMEO.\nOut.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nOf love?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nOut of her favour where I am in love.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,\n"
- "Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\n"
- "Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\n"
- "Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\n"
- "Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\n"
- "Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\n"
- "Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\n"
- "O anything, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\n"
- "Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\n"
- "Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\n"
- "Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\n"
- "This love feel I, that feel no love in this.\n"
- "Dost thou not laugh?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nNo coz, I rather weep.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGood heart, at what?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAt thy good heart’s oppression.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\n"
- "Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\n"
- "Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest\n"
- "With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\n"
- "Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\n"
- "Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\n"
- "Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\n"
- "Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’"
- " tears:\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\n"
- "A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz.\n\n"
- " [_Going._]\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nSoft! I will go along:\n"
- "And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\n"
- "This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,\n"
- "A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.\n"
- "In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\n"
- "I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you "
- "lov’d.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nA right good markman, and she’s fair I love.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWell, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit\n"
- "With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;\n"
- "And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,\n"
- "From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.\n"
- "She will not stay the siege of loving terms\n"
- "Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,\n"
- "Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\n"
- "O she’s rich in beauty, only poor\n"
- "That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\n"
- "For beauty starv’d with her severity,\n"
- "Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\n"
- "She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,\n"
- "To merit bliss by making me despair.\n"
- "She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\n"
- "Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nBe rul’d by me, forget to think of her.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO teach me how I should forget to think.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\nExamine other beauties.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis the way\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\n"
- "These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,\n"
- "Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;\n"
- "He that is strucken blind cannot forget\n"
- "The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\n"
- "Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\n"
- "What doth her beauty serve but as a note\n"
- "Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?\n"
- "Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nI’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Street.\n\n"
- " Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\n"
- "In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,\n"
- "For men so old as we to keep the peace.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nOf honourable reckoning are you both,\n"
- "And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.\n"
- "But now my lord, what say you to my suit?\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nBut saying o’er what I have said before.\n"
- "My child is yet a stranger in the world,\n"
- "She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\n"
- "Let two more summers wither in their pride\n"
- "Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nAnd too soon marr’d are those so early made.\n"
- "The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,\n"
- "She is the hopeful lady of my earth:\n"
- "But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\n"
- "My will to her consent is but a part;\n"
- "And she agree, within her scope of choice\n"
- "Lies my consent and fair according voice.\n"
- "This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,\n"
- "Whereto I have invited many a guest,\n"
- "Such as I love, and you among the store,\n"
- "One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\n"
- "At my poor house look to behold this night\n"
- "Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\n"
- "Such comfort as do lusty young men feel\n"
- "When well apparell’d April on the heel\n"
- "Of limping winter treads, even such delight\n"
- "Among fresh female buds shall you this night\n"
- "Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\n"
- "And like her most whose merit most shall be:\n"
- "Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,\n"
- "May stand in number, though in reckoning none.\n"
- "Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about\n"
- "Through fair Verona; find those persons out\n"
- "Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them "
- "say,\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nFind them out whose names are written here! It is written that the\n"
- "shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the\n"
- "fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent "
- "to\nfind those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what\n"
- "names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. "
- "In good\ntime!\n\n Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,\n"
- "One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;\n"
- "Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\n"
- "One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:\n"
- "Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\n"
- "And the rank poison of the old will die.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nYour plantain leaf is excellent for that.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nFor what, I pray thee?\n\nROMEO.\nFor your broken shin.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNot mad, but bound more than a madman is:\n"
- "Shut up in prison, kept without my food,\n"
- "Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\n"
- "God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, mine own fortune in my misery.\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nPerhaps you have learned it without book.\n"
- "But I pray, can you read anything you see?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, If I know the letters and the language.\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nYe say honestly, rest you merry!\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nStay, fellow; I can read.\n\n"
- " [_He reads the letter._]\n\n"
- "_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\n"
- "County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\nThe lady widow of Utruvio;\n"
- "Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;\nMercutio and his brother Valentine;\n"
- "Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\n"
- "My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;\n"
- "Lucio and the lively Helena. _\n\n\n"
- "A fair assembly. "
- "[_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nUp.\n\nROMEO.\nWhither to supper?\n\nSERVANT.\nTo our house.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhose house?\n\nSERVANT.\nMy master’s.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIndeed I should have ask’d you that before.\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\n"
- "Now I’ll tell you without asking. "
- "My master is the great rich Capulet,\n"
- "and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush "
- "a\ncup of wine. Rest you merry.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAt this same ancient feast of Capulet’s\n"
- "Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;\n"
- "With all the admired beauties of Verona.\n"
- "Go thither and with unattainted eye,\n"
- "Compare her face with some that I shall show,\n"
- "And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhen the devout religion of mine eye\n"
- "Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;\n"
- "And these who, often drown’d, could never die,\n"
- "Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.\n"
- "One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\n"
- "Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,\n"
- "Herself pois’d with herself in either eye:\n"
- "But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d\n"
- "Your lady’s love against some other maid\n"
- "That I will show you shining at this feast,\n"
- "And she shall scant show well that now shows best.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,\n"
- "But to rejoice in splendour of my own.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House.\n\n"
- " Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\n"

- "NURSE.\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,\n"
- "Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\n"
- "Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—\n"
- "Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\n"
- "She was too good for me. But as I said,\n"
- "On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\n"
- "That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\n"
- "’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\n"
- "And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,\n"
- "Of all the days of the year, upon that day:\n"
- "For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\n"
- "Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;\n"
- "My lord and you were then at Mantua:\n"
- "Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,\n"
- "When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\n"

- "Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I "

- "And since that time it is eleven years;\n"

- "For even the day before she broke her brow,\n"
- "And then my husband,—God be with his soul!\n"

- "And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,\n"
- "To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;\n"
- "And yet I warrant it had upon it brow\n"
- "A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;\n"

- "I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\n"
- "How stands your disposition to be married?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIt is an honour that I dream not of.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAn honour! Were not I thine only nurse,\n"
- "I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, think of marriage now: younger than you,\n"
- "Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\nAre made already mothers. By my count\n"

- "For fair without the fair within to hide.\n"
- "That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,\n"
- "That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\n"
- "So shall you share all that he doth possess,\n"
- "By having him, making yourself no less.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nNo less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI’ll look to like, if looking liking move:\n"
- "But no more deep will I endart mine eye\n"

- "ROMEO.\nWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\n"
- "Or shall we on without apology?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThe date is out of such prolixity:\n"
- "We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,\n"
- "Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,\n"
- "Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;\n"
- "Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\n"
- "After the prompter, for our entrance:\n"
- "But let them measure us by what they will,\n"
- "We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGive me a torch, I am not for this ambling;\n"
- "Being but heavy I will bear the light.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNot I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,\n"
- "With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead\n"
- "So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nYou are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,\n"
- "And soar with them above a common bound.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\n"
- "To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,\n"
- "I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\n"
- "Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;\n"
- "Too great oppression for a tender thing.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,\n"
- "Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;\n"
- "Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\n"
- "Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a "
- "mask._]\nA visor for a visor. What care I\n"
- "What curious eye doth quote deformities?\n"
- "Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in\n"
- "But every man betake him to his legs.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nA torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,\n"
- "Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\n"
- "For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,\n"
- "I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,\n"
- "The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:\n"
- "If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire\n"
- "Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest\n"
- "Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNay, that’s not so.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nI mean sir, in delay\n"
- "We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.\n"
- "Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\n"
- "Five times in that ere once in our five wits.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\n"
- "But ’tis no wit to go.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWhy, may one ask?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAnd so did I.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWell what was yours?\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThat dreamers often lie.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\n"
- "She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes\n"
- "In shape no bigger than an agate-stone\n"
- "On the fore-finger of an alderman,\n"
- "Drawn with a team of little atomies\n"
- "Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:\n"
- "Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;\n"
- "The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\n"
- "Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;\n"
- "The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;\n"
- "Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;\n"
- "Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\n"
- "Not half so big as a round little worm\n"
- "Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:\n"
- "Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\n"
- "Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\n"
- "Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.\n"
- "And in this state she gallops night by night\n"
- "Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;\n"
- "O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;\n"
- "O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;\n"
- "O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,\n"
- "Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\n"
- "Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\n"
- "Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,\n"
- "And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\n"
- "And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,\n"
- "Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,\n"
- "Then dreams he of another benefice:\n"
- "Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,\n"
- "And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\n"
- "Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,\n"
- "Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon\n"
- "Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;\n"
- "And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,\n"
- "And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\n"
- "That plats the manes of horses in the night;\n"
- "And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,\n"
- "Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\n"
- "This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\n"
- "That presses them, and learns them first to bear,\n"
- "Making them women of good carriage:\nThis is she,—\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,\n"
- "Thou talk’st of nothing.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\n"
- "Which are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\n"
- "Which is as thin of substance as the air,\n"
- "And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\n"
- "Even now the frozen bosom of the north,\n"
- "And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,\n"
- "Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:\n"
- "Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives\n"
- "Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\n"
- "With this night’s revels; and expire the term\n"
- "Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast\n"
- "By some vile forfeit of untimely death.\n"
- "But he that hath the steerage of my course\n"
- "Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!\n\nBENVOLIO.\nStrike, drum.\n\n"

- "Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,\n"
- "I conjure only but to raise up him.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, he hath hid himself among these trees\n"
- "To be consorted with the humorous night.\n"
- "Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nIf love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.\n"
- "Now will he sit under a medlar tree,\n"
- "And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit\n"
- "As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.\n"
- "O Romeo, that she were, O that she were\n"
- "An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!\n"
- "Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.\n"
- "This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.\n"
- "Come, shall we go?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGo then; for ’tis in vain\n"

- " Juliet appears above at a window.\n\n"
- "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\n"
- "It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!\n"
- "Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,\n"
- "Who is already sick and pale with grief,\n"
- "That thou her maid art far more fair than she.\n"
- "Be not her maid since she is envious;\n"
- "Her vestal livery is but sick and green,\n"
- "And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.\n"
- "It is my lady, O it is my love!\n"
- "O, that she knew she were!\n"
- "She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\n"
- "Her eye discourses, I will answer it.\n"
- "I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.\n"
- "Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\n"
- "Having some business, do entreat her eyes\n"
- "To twinkle in their spheres till they return.\n"
- "What if her eyes were there, they in her head?\n"
- "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,\n"
- "As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\n"
- "Would through the airy region stream so bright\n"
- "That birds would sing and think it were not night.\n"
- "See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.\n"
- "O that I were a glove upon that hand,\n"
- "That I might touch that cheek.\n\nJULIET.\nAy me.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nShe speaks.\nO speak again bright angel, for thou art\n"
- "As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,\n"
- "As is a winged messenger of heaven\nUnto the white-upturned wondering eyes\n"
- "Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n"
- "When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds\n"
- "And sails upon the bosom of the air.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\n"
- "Deny thy father and refuse thy name.\n"
- "Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n"
- "And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\n"
- "[_Aside."
- "_] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\n’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;\n"
- "Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\n"
- "What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,\n"
- "Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part\n"
- "Belonging to a man. O be some other name.\n"
- "What’s in a name? That which we call a rose\n"
- "By any other name would smell as sweet;\n"
- "So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,\n"
- "Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n"
- "Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\n"
- "And for thy name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI take thee at thy word.\n"
- "Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d"
- ";\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night\n"
- "So stumblest on my counsel?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBy a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:\n"
- "My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\n"
- "Because it is an enemy to thee.\n"
- "Had I it written, I would tear the word.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\n"
- "Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.\n"
- "Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNeither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\n"
- "How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\n"
- "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\n"
- "And the place death, considering who thou art,\n"
- "If any of my kinsmen find thee here.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\n"
- "With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,\n"
- "For stony limits cannot hold love out,\n"
- "And what love can do, that dares love attempt:\n"
- "Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye\n"
- "Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,\n"
- "And I am proof against their enmity.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI would not for the world they saw thee here.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,\n"
- "And but thou love me, let them find me here.\n"
- "My life were better ended by their hate\n"
- "Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nBy whose direction found’st thou out this place?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBy love, that first did prompt me to enquire;\n"
- "He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\n"
- "I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far\n"
- "As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,\n"
- "I should adventure for such merchandise.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,\n"
- "Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\n"
- "For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.\n"
- "Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\n"
- "What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.\n"
- "Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,\n"
- "And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,\n"
- "Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,\n"
- "They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\n"
- "If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\n"
- "Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\n"
- "I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,\n"
- "So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.\n"
- "In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;\n"
- "And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:\n"
- "But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true\n"
- "Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\n"
- "I should have been more strange, I must confess,\n"
- "But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,\n"
- "My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,\n"
- "And not impute this yielding to light love,\n"
- "Which the dark night hath so discovered.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\n"
- "That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—\n\n"
- "JULIET.\n"
- "O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,\n"
- "That monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat shall I swear by?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nDo not swear at all.\n"
- "Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\n"
- "Which is the god of my idolatry,\n"
- "And I’ll believe thee.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIf my heart’s dear love,—\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\n"
- "I have no joy of this contract tonight;\n"
- "It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\n"
- "Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be\n"
- "Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.\n"
- "This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,\n"
- "May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\n"
- "Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest\n"
- "Come to thy heart as that within my breast.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\n"
- "And yet I would it were to give again.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\n"
- "And yet I wish but for the thing I have;\n"
- "My bounty is as boundless as the sea,\n"
- "My love as deep; the more I give to thee,\n"
- "The more I have, for both are infinite.\n"
- "I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.\n"
- "[_Nurse calls within._]\n"
- "Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.\n"
- "Stay but a little, I will come again.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,\n"
- "Being in night, all this is but a dream,\n"
- "Too flattering sweet to be substantial.\n\n Enter Juliet above.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\n"
- "If that thy bent of love be honourable,\n"
- "Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,\n"
- "By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,\n"
- "Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,\n"
- "And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay\n"
- "And follow thee my lord throughout the world.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\n[_Within._] Madam.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\n"
- "I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,\n"
- "I do beseech thee,—\n\n"
- "NURSE.\n[_Within._] Madam.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nBy and by I come—\n"
- "To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.\nTomorrow will I send.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nSo thrive my soul,—\n\nJULIET.\nA thousand times good night.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nA thousand times the worse, to want thy light.\n"
- "Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,\n"
- "But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\n\n"
- " [_Retiring slowly._]\n\n Re-enter Juliet, above.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\n"
- "Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice\n"
- "To lure this tassel-gentle back again.\n"
- "Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,\n"
- "Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\n"
- "And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\n"
- "With repetition of my Romeo’s name.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name.\n"
- "How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,\n"
- "Like softest music to attending ears.\n\nJULIET.\nRomeo.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nMy nyas?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat o’clock tomorrow\nShall I send to thee?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBy the hour of nine.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.\n"
- "I have forgot why I did call thee back.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nLet me stand here till thou remember it.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\n"
- "Remembering how I love thy company.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAnd I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\n"
- "Forgetting any other home but this.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\n’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,\n"
- "And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,\n"
- "That lets it hop a little from her hand,\n"
- "Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\n"
- "And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\n"
- "So loving-jealous of his liberty.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI would I were thy bird.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nSweet, so would I:\n"
- "Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\n"
- "Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\n"
- "That I shall say good night till it be morrow.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.\n"
- "Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.\n"
- "The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,\n"
- "Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;\n"
- "And darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels\n"
- "From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheels\n"
- "Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,\n"
- "His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\n\n"

- "The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,\n"
- "I must upfill this osier cage of ours\n"
- "With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\n"
- "The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;\n"
- "What is her burying grave, that is her womb:\n"
- "And from her womb children of divers kind\n"
- "We sucking on her natural bosom find.\nMany for many virtues excellent,\n"
- "None but for some, and yet all different.\n"
- "O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\n"
- "In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.\n"
- "For naught so vile that on the earth doth live\n"
- "But to the earth some special good doth give;\n"
- "Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,\n"
- "Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\n"
- "Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied,\n"
- "And vice sometime’s by action dignified.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "Within the infant rind of this weak flower\n"
- "Poison hath residence, and medicine power:\n"
- "For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\n"
- "Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\n"
- "Two such opposed kings encamp them still\n"
- "In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;\n"
- "And where the worser is predominant,\n"
- "Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGood morrow, father.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBenedicite!\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\n"
- "Young son, it argues a distemper’d head\n"
- "So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\n"
- "Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,\n"
- "And where care lodges sleep will never lie;\n"
- "But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain\n"
- "Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\n"
- "Therefore thy earliness doth me assure\n"
- "Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;\n"
- "Or if not so, then here I hit it right,\n"
- "Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\n"
- "I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\n"
- "That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\n"
- "I have been feasting with mine enemy,\n"
- "Where on a sudden one hath wounded me\n"
- "That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies\n"
- "Within thy help and holy physic lies.\n"
- "I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,\n"
- "My intercession likewise steads my foe.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;\n"
- "Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThen plainly know my heart’s dear love is set\n"
- "On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.\n"
- "As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\n"
- "And all combin’d, save what thou must combine\n"
- "By holy marriage. When, and where, and how\n"
- "We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,\n"
- "I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\n"
- "That thou consent to marry us today.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHoly Saint Francis! What a change is here!\n"
- "Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\n"
- "So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies\n"
- "Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\n"
- "Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine\n"
- "Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\n"
- "How much salt water thrown away in waste,\n"
- "To season love, that of it doth not taste.\n"
- "The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\n"
- "Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\n"
- "Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\n"
- "Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\n"
- "If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine"
- ",\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\n"
- "And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,\n"
- "Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAnd bad’st me bury love.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNot in a grave\n"

- "Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.\nThe other did not so.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, she knew well\n"
- "Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\n"
- "But come young waverer, come go with me,\n"
- "In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;\n"
- "For this alliance may so happy prove,\n"
- "To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\n\n"

- "Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white "

- "cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. "
- "And is he a man to encounter\nTybalt?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "More than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\n"
- "compliments. "
- "He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\n"
- "and proportion. "
- "He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\n"
- "your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, "
- "a duellist;\n"
- "a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. "
- "Ah,\n"
- "the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThe what?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; "

- "of accent. "
- "By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\n"

- "Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that "

- "ROMEO.\n"
- "Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\n"

- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours "

- "[_Sings._]\n    An old hare hoar,\n"
- "    And an old hare hoar,\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\n"

- "I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\n"
- "Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I"

- "looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. "
- "Doth not rosemary and\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\n"
- "Ah, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. "
- "R is for the—no, I know it begins\n"

- "JULIET.\n"
- "Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad"
- "?\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\n"
- "If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news\n"
- "By playing it to me with so sour a face.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\n"
- "Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\n"
- "Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\n"
- "Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? "
- "Do you not see that I am\nout of breath?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\n"
- "To say to me that thou art out of breath?\n"
- "The excuse that thou dost make in this delay\n"
- "Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\n"
- "Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\n"
- "Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\n"

- "NURSE.\n"
- "Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a "

- "Romeo? No, not he. "
- "Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\n"

- " Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\n"
- "That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\n"
- "It cannot countervail the exchange of joy\n"
- "That one short minute gives me in her sight.\n"
- "Do thou but close our hands with holy words,\n"
- "Then love-devouring death do what he dare,\n"
- "It is enough I may but call her mine.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\n"
- "And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\n"
- "Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\n"
- "Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,\n"
- "And in the taste confounds the appetite.\n"
- "Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;\n"
- "Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\n"
- "Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot\n"
- "Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\n"
- "A lover may bestride the gossamers\n"
- "That idles in the wanton summer air\n"
- "And yet not fall; so light is vanity.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\n"
- "Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\n"
- "To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\n"
- "This neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\n"
- "Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both\n"
- "Receive in either by this dear encounter.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\n"
- "Brags of his substance, not of ornament.\n"
- "They are but beggars that can count their worth;\n"
- "But my true love is grown to such excess,\n"
- "I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\n"
- "For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\n"

- "And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\n"
- "For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\n"
- "a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God "
- "send me no\n"
- "need of thee!’ "
- "and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\n"
- "drawer, when indeed there is no need.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAm I like such a fellow?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in "
- "Italy; and as\n"
- "soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAnd what to?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one "
- "would\n"
- "kill the other. Thou? "
- "Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\n"
- "hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. "
- "Thou wilt quarrel\n"
- "with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\n"
- "hast hazel eyes. "
- "What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\n"
- "Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, "
- "and yet thy\n"
- "head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. "
- "Thou hast\n"
- "quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\n"
- "wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. "
- "Didst thou not fall\n"
- "out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\n"
- "another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? "
- "And yet thou wilt\ntutor me from quarrelling!\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\n"
- "And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the "
- "fee\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThe fee simple! O simple!\n\n Enter Tybalt and others.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nBy my heel, I care not.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\n"
- "Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "And but one word with one of us? "
- "Couple it with something; make it a\nword and a blow.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\n"
- "You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\n"
- "occasion.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? "
- "And thou make minstrels of\n"
- "us, look to hear nothing but discords. "
- "Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\n"
- "that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\n"
- "Either withdraw unto some private place,\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\n"
- "Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\n"
- "I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\n"
- "Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\n"
- "Your worship in that sense may call him man.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\n"
- "No better term than this: Thou art a villain.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\n"
- "Doth much excuse the appertaining rage\n"
- "To such a greeting. Villain am I none;\n"
- "Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\n"
- "That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\n"
- "But love thee better than thou canst devise\n"
- "Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.\n"
- "And so good Capulet, which name I tender\n"
- "As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\n"
- "[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\n"
- "Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean "
- "to\n"
- "make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, "
- "dry-beat the rest\n"
- "of the eight. "
- "Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\n"
- "Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\n\n"

- "Marry, ’tis enough.\n"
- "Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\n\n"
- " [_Exit Page._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n"
- "No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a"

- "enough, ’twill serve. "
- "Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\n"

- "MERCUTIO.\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\n"
- "Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\n"

- "BENVOLIO.\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;\n"
- "Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\n"
- "How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal\n"
- "Your high displeasure. All this uttered\n"
- "With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\n"
- "Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\n"
- "Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\n"
- "With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\n"
- "Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\n"
- "And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\n"
- "Cold death aside, and with the other sends\n"
- "It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\n"
- "‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ "
- "and swifter than his tongue,\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\n"
- "And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\n"
- "An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\n"
- "Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\n"
- "But by and by comes back to Romeo,\n"
- "Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,\n"
- "And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\n"
- "Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\n"
- "And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\n"
- "This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\n"
- "Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.\n"
- "Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,\n"
- "And all those twenty could but kill one life.\n"
- "I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\n"
- "Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\n"
- "Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\n"
- "His fault concludes but what the law should end,\nThe life of Tybalt.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nAnd for that offence\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\n"
- "I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\n"
- "My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\n"
- "But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\n"
- "That you shall all repent the loss of mine.\n"
- "I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\n"

- "And pay no worship to the garish sun.\n"
- "O, I have bought the mansion of a love,\n"

- "Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?\n"
- "This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.\n"
- "Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,\n"

- "Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\n"

- "Much more than death. Do not say banishment.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\n"
- "Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\n"
- "But purgatory, torture, hell itself.\n"
- "Hence banished is banish’d from the world,\n"
- "And world’s exile is death. Then banished\n"
- "Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\n"
- "Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,\n"
- "And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\n"
- "Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\n"

- "And turn’d that black word death to banishment.\n"
- "This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.\n\n"

- "Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\n"
- "And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\n"
- "Live here in heaven and may look on her,\n"
- "But Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\n"

- "And steal immortal blessing from her lips,\n"
- "Who, even in pure and vestal modesty\n"

- "And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\n"
- "Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\n"
- "No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\n"
- "But banished to kill me? Banished?\n"
- "O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\n"

- "Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\n"
- "To comfort thee, though thou art banished.\n\n"

- "And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\n"
- "And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAs if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\n"
- "Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand\n"
- "Murder’d her kinsman. "
- "O, tell me, Friar, tell me,\n"
- "In what vile part of this anatomy\n"

- "And usest none in that true use indeed\n"
- "Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\n"
- "Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,\n"

- "Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\n"
- "Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\n\n"

- "I must be gone and live, or stay and die.\n\n"

- "How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. "

- " Enter Lady Capulet.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWhy, how now, Juliet?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nMadam, I am not well.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nEvermore weeping for your cousin’s death?\n"
- "What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\n"
- "And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\n"
- "Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,\n"
- "But much of grief shows still some want of wit.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\n"
- "Which you weep for.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nFeeling so the loss,\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\n"
- "Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death\n"
- "As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat villain, madam?\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nThat same villain Romeo.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nVillain and he be many miles asunder.\n"
- "God pardon him. I do, with all my heart.\n"
- "And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThat is because the traitor murderer lives.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAy madam, from the reach of these my hands.\n"
- "Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\n"
- "Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,\n"
- "Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,\n"
- "Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram\n"
- "That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:\n"
- "And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIndeed I never shall be satisfied\n"
- "With Romeo till I behold him—dead—\n"
- "Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.\n"
- "Madam, if you could find out but a man\n"
- "To bear a poison, I would temper it,\n"
- "That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,\n"
- "Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\n"
- "To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,\n"
- "To wreak the love I bore my cousin\n"
- "Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\n"
- "Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.\n"
- "But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAnd joy comes well in such a needy time.\n"
- "What are they, I beseech your ladyship?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\n"
- "One who to put thee from thy heaviness,\n"
- "Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,\n"
- "That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nMadam, in happy time, what day is that?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn\n"
- "The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\n"
- "The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,\n"
- "Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNow by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,\n"
- "He shall not make me there a joyful bride.\n"
- "I wonder at this haste, that I must wed\n"
- "Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.\n"
- "I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\n"
- "I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\n"
- "It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\n"
- "Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHere comes your father, tell him so yourself,\n"
- "And see how he will take it at your hands.\n\n Enter Capulet and Nurse.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWhen the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;\n"
- "But for the sunset of my brother’s son\nIt rains downright.\n"
- "How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\n"
- "Evermore showering? In one little body\n"
- "Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.\n"
- "For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\n"
- "Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,\n"
- "Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,\n"
- "Who raging with thy tears and they with them,\n"
- "Without a sudden calm will overset\n"
- "Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\n"
- "Have you deliver’d to her our decree?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\n"
- "Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\n"
- "I would the fool were married to her grave.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nSoft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.\n"
- "How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\n"
- "Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\n"
- "Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought\n"
- "So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNot proud you have, but thankful that you have.\n"
- "Proud can I never be of what I hate;\n"
- "But thankful even for hate that is meant love.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\n"
- "How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?\n"
- "Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;\n"
- "And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,\n"
- "Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\n"
- "But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next\n"
- "To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,\n"
- "Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\n"
- "Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!\n"
- "You tallow-face!\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nFie, fie! What, are you mad?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nGood father, I beseech you on my knees,\n"
- "Hear me with patience but to speak a word.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nHang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!\n"
- "I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,\n"
- "Or never after look me in the face.\n"
- "Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.\n"
- "My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\n"
- "That God had lent us but this only child;\n"
- "But now I see this one is one too much,\n"
- "And that we have a curse in having her.\n"
- "Out on her, hilding.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nGod in heaven bless her.\n"
- "You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nAnd why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,\n"
- "Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nI speak no treason.\n\nCAPULET.\nO God ye good-en!\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nMay not one speak?\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nPeace, you mumbling fool!\n"
- "Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,\n"
- "For here we need it not.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nYou are too hot.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nGod’s bread, it makes me mad!\n"
- "Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,\n"
- "Alone, in company, still my care hath been\n"
- "To have her match’d, and having now provided\n"
- "A gentleman of noble parentage,\n"
- "Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,\n"
- "Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,\n"
- "Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,\n"
- "And then to have a wretched puling fool,\n"
- "A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,\n"
- "To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,\n"
- "I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’\n"
- "But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.\n"
- "Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.\n"
- "Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to "
- "jest.\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.\n"
- "And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;\n"
- "And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets"
- ",\nFor by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,\n"
- "Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.\n"
- "Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be "
- "forsworn.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIs there no pity sitting in the clouds,\n"
- "That sees into the bottom of my grief?\n"
- "O sweet my mother, cast me not away,\n"
- "Delay this marriage for a month, a week,\n"
- "Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed\n"
- "In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\n"
- "Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.\n"
- "Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?\n"
- "My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.\n"
- "How shall that faith return again to earth,\n"
- "Unless that husband send it me from heaven\n"
- "By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.\n"
- "Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems\n"
- "Upon so soft a subject as myself.\n"
- "What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\n"
- "Some comfort, Nurse.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nFaith, here it is.\n"
- "Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing\n"
- "That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.\n"
- "Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\n"
- "Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,\n"
- "I think it best you married with the County.\n"
- "O, he’s a lovely gentleman.\n"
- "Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\n"
- "Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\n"
- "As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\n"
- "I think you are happy in this second match,\n"
- "For it excels your first: or if it did not,\n"
- "Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,\n"
- "As living here and you no use of him.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nSpeakest thou from thy heart?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAnd from my soul too,\nOr else beshrew them both.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAmen.\n\nNURSE.\nWhat?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWell, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\n"
- "Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,\n"
- "Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,\n"
- "To make confession and to be absolv’d.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nMarry, I will; and this is wisely done.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAncient damnation! O most wicked fiend!\n"
- "Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,\n"
- "Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue\n"
- "Which she hath prais’d him with above compare\n"
- "So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.\n"
- "Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.\n"
- "I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.\n"
- "If all else fail, myself have power to die.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n"
- "ACT IV\n\nSCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\n\n"
- " Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nOn Thursday, sir? The time is very short.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nMy father Capulet will have it so;\n"
- "And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nYou say you do not know the lady’s mind.\n"
- "Uneven is the course; I like it not.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,\n"
- "And therefore have I little talk’d of love;\n"
- "For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\n"
- "Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous\n"
- "That she do give her sorrow so much sway;\n"
- "And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,\n"
- "To stop the inundation of her tears,\n"
- "Which, too much minded by herself alone,\n"
- "May be put from her by society.\n"
- "Now do you know the reason of this haste.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\n"
- "[_Aside."
- "_] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—\n"
- "Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nHappily met, my lady and my wife!\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nThat may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat must be shall be.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThat’s a certain text.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nCome you to make confession to this father?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nTo answer that, I should confess to you.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nDo not deny to him that you love me.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI will confess to you that I love him.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIf I do so, it will be of more price,\n"
- "Being spoke behind your back than to your face.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nPoor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThe tears have got small victory by that;\n"
- "For it was bad enough before their spite.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nThou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,\n"
- "And what I spake, I spake it to my face.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\n"
- "Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own.\n"
- "Are you at leisure, holy father, now,\n"
- "Or shall I come to you at evening mass?\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—\n"
- "My lord, we must entreat the time alone.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!—\n"
- "Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,\n"
- "Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO shut the door, and when thou hast done so,\n"
- "Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief;\n"
- "It strains me past the compass of my wits.\n"
- "I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\n"
- "On Thursday next be married to this County.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nTell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,\n"
- "Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\n"
- "If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,\n"
- "Do thou but call my resolution wise,\n"
- "And with this knife I’ll help it presently.\n"
- "God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;\n"
- "And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,\n"
- "Shall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\n"
- "Turn to another, this shall slay them both.\n"
- "Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,\n"
- "Give me some present counsel, or behold\n"
- "’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\n"
- "Shall play the empire, arbitrating that\n"
- "Which the commission of thy years and art\n"
- "Could to no issue of true honour bring.\n"
- "Be not so long to speak. I long to die,\n"
- "If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\n"
- "Which craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\n"
- "If, rather than to marry County Paris\n"
- "Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\n"
- "Then is it likely thou wilt undertake\n"
- "A thing like death to chide away this shame,\n"
- "That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.\n"
- "And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\n"
- "From off the battlements of yonder tower,\n"
- "Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\n"
- "Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;\n"
- "Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,\n"
- "O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,\n"
- "With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.\n"
- "Or bid me go into a new-made grave,\n"
- "And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;\n"
- "Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,\n"
- "And I will do it without fear or doubt,\n"
- "To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold then. Go home, be merry, give consent\n"
- "To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;\nTomorrow night look that thou lie alone,\n"
- "Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\n"
- "Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\n"
- "And this distilled liquor drink thou off,\n"
- "When presently through all thy veins shall run\n"
- "A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\n"
- "Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.\n"
- "No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,\n"
- "The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\n"
- "To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,\n"
- "Like death when he shuts up the day of life.\n"
- "Each part depriv’d of supple government,\n"
- "Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.\n"
- "And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death\n"
- "Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,\n"
- "And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\n"
- "Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes\n"
- "To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\n"
- "Then as the manner of our country is,\n"
- "In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,\n"
- "Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\n"
- "Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\n"
- "In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,\n"
- "Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,\n"
- "And hither shall he come, and he and I\n"
- "Will watch thy waking, and that very night\n"
- "Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\n"
- "And this shall free thee from this present shame,\n"
- "If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\n"
- "Abate thy valour in the acting it.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nGive me, give me! O tell not me of fear!\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous\n"
- "In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed\n"
- "To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nLove give me strength, and strength shall help afford.\n"
- "Farewell, dear father.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n"

- "Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.\n\n"
- "SECOND SERVANT.\n"
- "You shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can "
- "lick their\nfingers.\n\nCAPULET.\nHow canst thou try them so?\n\n"
- "SECOND SERVANT.\n"
- "Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;\n"
- "therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nGo, begone.\n\n [_Exit second Servant._]\n\n"
- "We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.\n"
- "What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAy, forsooth.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWell, he may chance to do some good on her.\n"
- "A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.\n\n"
- " Enter Juliet.\n\nNURSE.\nSee where she comes from shrift with merry look.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\n"
- "How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhere I have learnt me to repent the sin\n"
- "Of disobedient opposition\n"
- "To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d\n"
- "By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,\n"
- "To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.\n"
- "Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nSend for the County, go tell him of this.\n"
- "I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,\n"
- "And gave him what becomed love I might,\n"
- "Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\n"
- "Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.\n"
- "This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.\n"
- "Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.\n"
- "Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,\n"
- "All our whole city is much bound to him.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNurse, will you go with me into my closet,\n"
- "To help me sort such needful ornaments\n"
- "As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nNo, not till Thursday. There is time enough.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\n"
- "Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWe shall be short in our provision,\n"
- "’Tis now near night.\n\n"

- " Enter Juliet and Nurse.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAy, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,\n"
- "I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;\n"
- "For I have need of many orisons\n"
- "To move the heavens to smile upon my state,\n"
- "Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.\n\n"
- " Enter Lady Capulet.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhat, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNo, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries\n"
- "As are behoveful for our state tomorrow.\n"
- "So please you, let me now be left alone,\n"
- "And let the nurse this night sit up with you,\n"
- "For I am sure you have your hands full all\nIn this so sudden business.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nGood night.\n"
- "Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]\n\n"

- "What if it be a poison, which the Friar\n"
- "Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,\n"
- "Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,\n"
- "Because he married me before to Romeo?\n"
- "I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,\n"
- "For he hath still been tried a holy man.\n"
- "How if, when I am laid into the tomb,\n"
- "I wake before the time that Romeo\n"
- "Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!\n"
- "Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,\n"
- "To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\n"
- "And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\n"
- "Or, if I live, is it not very like,\n"
- "The horrible conceit of death and night,\n"
- "Together with the terror of the place,\n"
- "As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,\n"
- "Where for this many hundred years the bones\n"
- "Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,\n"
- "Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\n"
- "Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,\n"
- "At some hours in the night spirits resort—\n"
- "Alack, alack, is it not like that I,\n"
- "So early waking, what with loathsome smells,\n"
- "And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,\n"
- "That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.\n"
- "O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\n"
- "Environed with all these hideous fears,\n"
- "And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?\n"
- "And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?\n"
- "And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,\n"
- "As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?\n"
- "O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost\n"
- "Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body\n"
- "Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!\n"

- "PRINCE.\nLook, and thou shalt see.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\n"
- "To press before thy father to a grave?\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\n"
- "Till we can clear these ambiguities,\n"
- "And know their spring, their head, their true descent,\n"
- "And then will I be general of your woes,\n"
- "And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\n"
- "And let mischance be slave to patience.\n"
- "Bring forth the parties of suspicion.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\n"
- "Yet most suspected, as the time and place\n"
- "Doth make against me, of this direful murder.\n"
- "And here I stand, both to impeach and purge\n"
- "Myself condemned and myself excus’d.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\n"
- "Is not so long as is a tedious tale.\n"
- "Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\n"
- "And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\n"
- "I married them; and their stol’n marriage day\n"
- "Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\n"
- "Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\n"
- "For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\n"
- "You, to remove that siege of grief from her,\n"
- "Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce\n"
- "To County Paris. Then comes she to me,\n"
- "And with wild looks, bid me devise some means\n"
- "To rid her from this second marriage,\n"
- "Or in my cell there would she kill herself.\n"
- "Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,\n"
- "A sleeping potion, which so took effect\n"
- "As I intended, for it wrought on her\n"
- "The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\n"
- "That he should hither come as this dire night\n"
- "To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\n"
- "Being the time the potion’s force should cease.\n"
- "But he which bore my letter, Friar John,\n"
- "Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight\n"
- "Return’d my letter back. Then all alone\n"
- "At the prefixed hour of her waking\n"
- "Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\n"
- "Meaning to keep her closely at my cell\n"
- "Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.\n"
- "But when I came, some minute ere the time\n"
- "Of her awaking, here untimely lay\n"
- "The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\n"
- "She wakes; and I entreated her come forth\n"
- "And bear this work of heaven with patience.\n"
- "But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\n"
- "And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\n"
- "But, as it seems, did violence on herself.\n"
- "All this I know; and to the marriage\n"
- "Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\n"
- "Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\n"
- "Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\n"
- "Unto the rigour of severest law.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\n"
- "Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\n\n"
- "BALTHASAR.\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\n"
- "And then in post he came from Mantua\n"
- "To this same place, to this same monument.\n"
- "This letter he early bid me give his father,\n"
- "And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\n"
- "If I departed not, and left him there.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\n"
- "Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\n"
- "Sirrah, what made your master in this place?\n\n"
- "PAGE.\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\n"
- "And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\n"
- "Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\n"
- "And by and by my master drew on him,\n"
- "And then I ran away to call the watch.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\n"
- "Their course of love, the tidings of her death.\n"
- "And here he writes that he did buy a poison\n"
- "Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\n"
- "Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\n"
- "Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\n"
- "See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\n"
- "That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\n"
- "And I, for winking at your discords too,\n"
- "Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\n"
- "This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nBut I can give thee more,\n"
- "For I will raise her statue in pure gold,\n"
- "That whiles Verona by that name is known,\n"
- "There shall no figure at such rate be set\n"
- "As that of true and faithful Juliet.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\n"
- "Poor sacrifices of our enmity.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\n"
- "The sun for sorrow will not show his head.\n"
- "Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\n"
- "Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\n"
- "For never was a story of more woe\n"
- "Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\n"
