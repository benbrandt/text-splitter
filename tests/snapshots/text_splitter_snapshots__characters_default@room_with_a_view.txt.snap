- "\n\n\n“The "
- "Signora "
- "had no "
- "business "
- "to do it,”"
- " said Miss"
- " Bartlett,"
- " “no "
- "business "
- "at all. "
- "She "
- "promised "
- "us south "
- rooms with
- " a view "
- "close "
- "together, "
- instead of
- " which "
- "here are "
- "north "
- "rooms, "
- "looking "
- "into a "
- "courtyard,"
- " and a "
- "long way "
- "apart. "
- "Oh, Lucy!”"
- "\n\n“And a "
- "Cockney, "
- "besides!” "
- "said Lucy,"
- " who had "
- "been "
- "further "
- "saddened "
- "by the "
- "Signora’s "
- unexpected
- " accent. "
- "“It might "
- be London.
- "” "
- She looked
- " at the "
- "two rows "
- of English
- " people "
- "who were "
- sitting at
- " the table"
- "; at the "
- "row of "
- "white "
- bottles of
- " water and"
- " red "
- bottles of
- " wine that"
- " ran "
- "between "
- "the "
- "English "
- people; at
- " the "
- "portraits "
- "of the "
- late Queen
- " and the "
- "late Poet "
- "Laureate "
- "that hung "
- behind the
- " English "
- "people, "
- "heavily "
- framed; at
- " the "
- "notice of "
- "the "
- "English "
- church (
- "Rev. "
- "Cuthbert "
- "Eager, M. "
- "A. Oxon.),"
- "\nthat was "
- "the only "
- "other "
- decoration
- " of the "
- "wall. "
- “Charlotte
- ", don’t "
- "you feel, "
- "too, that "
- "we might "
- "be in "
- "London? "
- "I can "
- "hardly "
- "believe "
- "that all "
- "kinds of "
- "other "
- things are
- " just "
- "outside. "
- "I suppose "
- "it is "
- "one’s "
- "being so "
- "tired.”\n\n"
- “This meat
- " has "
- "surely "
- "been used "
- "for soup,”"
- " said Miss"
- " Bartlett,"
- " laying "
- "down her "
- "fork.\n\n"
- “I want so
- " to see "
- "the Arno. "
- "The rooms "
- "the "
- "Signora "
- "promised "
- "us in her "
- "letter "
- would have
- " looked "
- "over the "
- "Arno. The "
- "Signora "
- "had no "
- "business "
- "to do it "
- "at all. "
- "Oh, it is "
- a shame!”
- "\n\n"
- "“Any nook "
- "does for "
- "me,” Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- continued;
- " “but it "
- "does seem "
- "hard that "
- "you "
- "shouldn’t "
- "have a "
- "view.”\n\n"
- "Lucy felt "
- "that she "
- "had been "
- "selfish. "
- “Charlotte
- ", you "
- "mustn’t "
- "spoil me:\n"
- "of course,"
- " you must "
- "look over "
- "the Arno, "
- "too. "
- "I meant "
- "that. "
- "The first "
- "vacant "
- "room in "
- the front—
- "” “You "
- "must have "
- "it,” said "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett, "
- "part of "
- "whose "
- travelling
- " expenses "
- "were paid "
- "by Lucy’s "
- "mother—a "
- "piece of "
- generosity
- " to which "
- "she made "
- "many a "
- "tactful "
- allusion.
- "\n\n"
- "“No, no. "
- "You must "
- have it.”
- "\n\n"
- "“I insist "
- "on it. "
- "Your "
- "mother "
- "would "
- "never "
- forgive me
- ", Lucy.”\n\n"
- “She would
- " never "
- "forgive "
- "_me_.”\n\n"
- The ladies
- "’ voices "
- "grew "
- "animated, "
- and—if the
- " sad truth"
- " be owned—"
- "a little "
- "peevish. "
- "They were "
- "tired, and"
- " under the"
- " guise of "
- unselfishn
- "ess they "
- "wrangled. "
- "Some of "
- "their "
- neighbours
- " "
- interchang
- ed glances
- ", and one "
- of them—
- one of the
- " ill-bred "
- "people "
- "whom one "
- "does meet "
- abroad—
- "leant "
- "forward "
- "over the "
- "table and "
- "actually "
- "intruded "
- into their
- " argument."
- " He said:"
- "\n\n"
- "“I have a "
- "view, I "
- "have a "
- "view.”\n\n"
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "was "
- "startled. "
- "Generally "
- "at a "
- "pension "
- "people "
- "looked "
- "them over "
- "for a day "
- "or two "
- "before "
- "speaking, "
- "and often "
- "did not "
- "find out "
- "that they "
- would “do”
- " till they"
- " had gone."
- " She knew "
- "that the "
- "intruder "
- was ill-
- "bred, even"
- " before "
- "she "
- glanced at
- " him. "
- "He was an "
- "old man, "
- "of heavy "
- "build, "
- "with a "
- "fair, "
- "shaven "
- "face and "
- large eyes
- ". "
- "There was "
- "something "
- "childish "
- "in those "
- "eyes, "
- "though it "
- "was not "
- "the "
- childishne
- "ss of "
- "senility.\n"
- "What "
- exactly it
- " was Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "did not "
- "stop to "
- "consider, "
- "for her "
- "glance "
- "passed on "
- "to his "
- "clothes. "
- "These did "
- "not "
- "attract "
- "her. "
- "He was "
- "probably "
- "trying to "
- "become "
- acquainted
- " with them"
- " before "
- "they got "
- "into the "
- "swim. "
- "So she "
- "assumed a "
- "dazed "
- expression
- " when he "
- "spoke to "
- "her, and "
- "then said:"
- " “A view? "
- "Oh, a view"
- "! How "
- delightful
- " a view is"
- "!”\n\n"
- "“This is "
- "my son,” "
- "said the "
- old man; “
- his name’s
- " George. "
- "He has a "
- view too.”
- "\n\n"
- "“Ah,” said"
- " Miss "
- "Bartlett, "
- repressing
- " Lucy, who"
- " was about"
- " to speak."
- "\n\n“What I "
- "mean,” he "
- "continued,"
- " “is that "
- "you can "
- "have our "
- "rooms, and"
- " we’ll "
- have yours
- ". We’ll "
- "change.”\n\n"
- The better
- " class of "
- "tourist "
- "was "
- shocked at
- " this, and"
- " "
- sympathize
- d with the
- " new-"
- "comers. "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett, "
- "in reply, "
- opened her
- " mouth as "
- "little as "
- "possible, "
- and said “
- "Thank you "
- "very much "
- "indeed; "
- "that is "
- out of the
- " question."
- "”\n\n“Why?” "
- "said the "
- "old man, "
- "with both "
- "fists on "
- the table.
- "\n\n"
- "“Because "
- "it is "
- "quite out "
- "of the "
- "question, "
- thank you.
- "”\n\n"
- "“You see, "
- "we don’t "
- "like to "
- "take—” "
- began Lucy
- ". "
- Her cousin
- " again "
- "repressed "
- "her.\n\n"
- “But why?”
- " he "
- persisted.
- " “Women "
- "like "
- looking at
- " a view; "
- men don’t.
- "” And he "
- "thumped "
- "with his "
- fists like
- " a naughty"
- " child, "
- and turned
- " to his "
- "son,\n"
- "saying, “"
- "George, "
- "persuade "
- "them!”\n\n"
- "“It’s so "
- "obvious "
- "they "
- "should "
- "have the "
- "rooms,” "
- "said the "
- "son. "
- "“There’s "
- "nothing "
- "else to "
- "say.”\n\n"
- He did not
- " look at "
- the ladies
- " as he "
- "spoke, but"
- " his voice"
- " was "
- "perplexed "
- "and "
- sorrowful.
- " "
- "Lucy, too,"
- " was "
- perplexed;
- " but she "
- "saw that "
- "they were "
- "in for "
- "what is "
- known as “
- "quite a "
- "scene,” "
- "and she "
- had an odd
- " feeling "
- "that "
- "whenever "
- these ill-
- "bred "
- "tourists "
- "spoke the "
- "contest "
- "widened "
- "and "
- "deepened "
- "till it "
- "dealt, not"
- " with "
- "rooms and "
- "views, but"
- " with—well"
- ", with "
- "something "
- "quite "
- "different,"
- " whose "
- "existence "
- "she had "
- "not "
- "realized "
- "before. "
- "Now the "
- "old man "
- "attacked "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "almost "
- "violently:"
- " Why "
- should she
- " not "
- "change? "
- "What "
- "possible "
- "objection "
- "had she? "
- They would
- " clear out"
- " in half "
- "an hour.\n\n"
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett, "
- "though "
- skilled in
- " the "
- delicacies
- " of "
- conversati
- "on, was "
- "powerless "
- "in the "
- "presence "
- "of "
- brutality.
- " It was "
- impossible
- " to snub "
- any one so
- " gross. "
- "Her face "
- "reddened "
- "with "
- displeasur
- "e. "
- She looked
- " around as"
- " much as "
- "to say, “"
- "Are you "
- "all like "
- "this?” "
- "And two "
- little old
- " ladies, "
- "who were "
- "sitting "
- further up
- " the table"
- ", with "
- "shawls "
- "hanging "
- "over the "
- "backs of "
- the chairs
- ", looked "
- "back, "
- "clearly "
- indicating
- " “We are "
- "not; we "
- "are "
- genteel.”
- "\n\n"
- "“Eat your "
- "dinner, "
- "dear,” she"
- " said to "
- "Lucy, and "
- "began to "
- "toy again "
- "with the "
- "meat that "
- "she had "
- "once "
- censured.
- "\n\nLucy "
- "mumbled "
- that those
- " seemed "
- "very odd "
- "people "
- opposite.
- "\n\n"
- "“Eat your "
- "dinner, "
- "dear. "
- "This "
- pension is
- " a failure"
- ". "
- "To-morrow "
- "we will "
- "make a "
- "change.”\n\n"
- Hardly had
- " she "
- "announced "
- "this fell "
- "decision "
- "when she "
- "reversed "
- "it. The "
- "curtains "
- at the end
- " of the "
- "room "
- "parted, "
- "and "
- revealed a
- " clergyman"
- ", stout "
- "but "
- attractive
- ", who "
- "hurried "
- forward to
- " take his "
- "place at "
- "the table,"
- "\n"
- cheerfully
- " "
- apologizin
- "g for his "
- "lateness. "
- "Lucy, who "
- "had not "
- "yet "
- "acquired "
- "decency, "
- "at once "
- "rose to "
- "her feet, "
- exclaiming
- ": “Oh, oh!"
- " "
- "Why, it’s "
- "Mr.\n"
- "Beebe! "
- "Oh, how "
- "perfectly "
- "lovely! "
- "Oh, "
- "Charlotte,"
- " we must "
- "stop now,\n"
- "however "
- "bad the "
- rooms are.
- " Oh!”\n\n"
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "said, with"
- " more "
- "restraint:"
- "\n\n“How do "
- "you do, Mr"
- ". Beebe? "
- "I expect "
- "that you "
- "have "
- "forgotten "
- "us: Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "and Miss "
- Honeychurc
- "h, who "
- "were at "
- "Tunbridge "
- Wells when
- " you "
- helped the
- " Vicar of "
- "St. "
- "Peter’s "
- "that very "
- "cold "
- "Easter.”\n\n"
- "The "
- "clergyman,"
- " who had "
- the air of
- " one on a "
- "holiday, "
- "did not "
- "remember "
- the ladies
- " quite as "
- clearly as
- " they "
- remembered
- " him. "
- "But he "
- "came "
- "forward "
- pleasantly
- " enough "
- "and "
- "accepted "
- "the chair "
- into which
- " he was "
- "beckoned "
- "by Lucy.\n\n"
- “I _am_ so
- " glad to "
- "see you,” "
- "said the "
- "girl, who "
- "was in a "
- "state of "
- "spiritual "
- starvation
- ", and "
- would have
- " been glad"
- " to see "
- the waiter
- " if her "
- cousin had
- " permitted"
- " it. "
- "“Just "
- "fancy how "
- "small the "
- "world is. "
- "Summer "
- "Street, "
- "too, makes"
- " it so "
- "specially "
- "funny.”\n\n"
- "“Miss "
- Honeychurc
- h lives in
- " the "
- "parish of "
- "Summer "
- "Street,” "
- "said Miss "
- "Bartlett, "
- filling up
- " the gap, "
- "“and she "
- "happened "
- to tell me
- " in the "
- "course of "
- conversati
- "on that "
- "you have "
- "just "
- "accepted "
- the living
- "—”\n\n"
- "“Yes, I "
- heard from
- " mother so"
- " last week"
- ". "
- She didn’t
- " know that"
- " I knew "
- "you at "
- "Tunbridge "
- Wells; but
- " I wrote "
- "back at "
- "once, and "
- "I said: ‘"
- "Mr. "
- Beebe is—’
- "”\n\n“Quite "
- "right,” "
- "said the "
- clergyman.
- " “I move "
- "into the "
- Rectory at
- " Summer "
- "Street "
- next June.
- " "
- I am lucky
- " to be "
- "appointed "
- "to such a "
- "charming "
- neighbourh
- "ood.”\n\n"
- "“Oh, how "
- glad I am!
- " The name "
- "of our "
- "house is "
- "Windy "
- "Corner.” "
- "Mr. Beebe "
- "bowed.\n\n"
- "“There is "
- mother and
- " me "
- "generally,"
- " and my "
- "brother, "
- "though "
- "it’s not "
- "often we "
- get him to
- " ch—— The "
- "church is "
- rather far
- " off, I "
- "mean.”\n\n"
- "“Lucy, "
- "dearest, "
- "let Mr. "
- "Beebe eat "
- his dinner
- ".”\n\n“I am "
- "eating it,"
- " thank you"
- ", and "
- "enjoying "
- "it.”\n\nHe "
- "preferred "
- to talk to
- " Lucy, "
- "whose "
- playing he
- " "
- remembered
- ", rather "
- "than to "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett, "
- "who "
- "probably "
- remembered
- " his "
- "sermons. "
- "He asked "
- "the girl "
- "whether "
- "she knew "
- "Florence "
- "well, and "
- "was "
- "informed "
- "at some "
- "length "
- "that she "
- "had never "
- been there
- " before. "
- "It is "
- delightful
- " to advise"
- " a "
- "newcomer, "
- and he was
- " first in "
- the field.
- " “Don’t "
- "neglect "
- "the "
- "country "
- "round,” "
- his advice
- " concluded"
- ". "
- “The first
- " fine "
- "afternoon "
- "drive up "
- to Fiesole
- ", and "
- "round by "
- Settignano
- ", or "
- "something "
- "of that "
- "sort.”\n\n"
- "“No!” "
- "cried a "
- voice from
- " the top "
- "of the "
- "table. "
- "“Mr. "
- "Beebe, you"
- " are wrong"
- ". "
- "The first "
- "fine "
- "afternoon "
- "your "
- "ladies "
- must go to
- " Prato.”\n\n"
- “That lady
- " looks so "
- "clever,” "
- "whispered "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "to her "
- "cousin. "
- “We are in
- " luck.”\n\n"
- "And, "
- "indeed, a "
- "perfect "
- torrent of
- " "
- informatio
- n burst on
- " them. "
- "People "
- "told them "
- "what to "
- "see, when "
- "to see it,"
- " how to "
- "stop the "
- "electric "
- "trams,\n"
- how to get

- "someone, "
- "who had "

- house near
- " Summer "
- Street the

- "year, but "
- "she had "
- "not liked "
- "it, which "
- was odd of

- "And just "
- "as Miss "
- Lavish had
- " got the "
- "name, she "
- "broke off "
- "and "
- "exclaimed:"

- We’ve lost

- "\n\n"
- "Certainly "

- "reaching "
- "Santa "
- "Croce, the"

- "which had "
- "been "
- "plainly "
- "visible "
- "from the "
- "landing "
- "window. "
- "But Miss "
- Lavish had
- " said so "
- much about
- " knowing "
- "her "
- "Florence "
- "by heart, "
- "that Lucy "
- "had "
- "followed "

- "Lucy, who "

- "Louisa,\n"
- and became

- "Lavish, "
- "with a "
- "shriek of "

- "forward, "

- "Lucy "
- waited for
- " nearly "
- "ten "
- "minutes. "
- "Then she "
- "began to "
- get tired.
- " The "
- "beggars "
- "worried "
- "her, the "
- "dust blew "
- "in her "
- "eyes, and "
- "she "
- remembered
- " that a "

- " ought not"
- " to loiter"
- " in public"

- "She "
- "descended "
- "slowly "
- "into the "
- "Piazza "
- "with the "
- "intention "
- "of "
- "rejoining "
- "Miss "
- "Lavish, "
- "who was "

- "both "
- gesticulat

- "Tears of "

- "partly "
- "because "
- "Miss "
- Lavish had
- " jilted "

- "A few "

- persuading

- "y. "
- "Now she "
- "entered "

- " able to "
- "remember "
- whether it
- " was built"
- " by the "
- Franciscan
- "s or the "
- Dominicans
- ". "
- "Of course,"

- "And how "
- very cold!
- " "
- "Of course,"

- "unwilling "
- "to be "
- enthusiast
- "ic over "
- "monuments "
- "of "
- "uncertain "

- "There was "

- "Italian "
- notices—
- "the "
- "notices "
- "that "
- "forbade "
- "people to "
- "introduce "

- and out of
- " respect "
- "to the "
- "sacred "
- edifice in
- " which "
- they found
- " "
- themselves

- "spit. She "
- "watched "
- "the "
- "tourists; "
- "their "
- noses were
- " as red as"
- " their "
- "Baedekers,"
- " so cold "
- "was Santa "
- "Croce. "
- She beheld
- " the "
- "horrible "
- "fate that "
- "overtook "
- "three "
- Papists—
- two he-

- " a she-"

- "began "
- "their "
- "career by "
- "sousing "
- each other
- " with the "
- Holy Water

- " to the "
- Machiavell

- "hallowed. "
- "Advancing "
- towards it
- " very "
- slowly and

- "My sister "

- "Beebe was "
- "right. "
- Lucy never
- " knew her "
- desires so
- " clearly "
- "as after "
- "music. "
- "She had "
- not really
- " "
- appreciate
- "d the "
- clergyman’
- "s wit, nor"
- " the "
- suggestive
- " "
- twittering
- "s of Miss "
- "Alan. "
- Conversati
- "on was "
- "tedious; "
- she wanted
- " something"
- " big, and "
- "she "
- "believed "
- "that it "
- would have
- " come to "
- her on the
- " wind-"
- "swept "
- "platform "
- "of an "
- "electric "
- "tram. "
- "This she "
- "might not "
- "attempt. "
- "It was "
- unladylike
- ". Why? "
- "Why were "
- "most big "
- "things "
- unladylike
- "?\n"
- "Charlotte "
- "had once "
- "explained "
- to her why
- ". "
- It was not
- " that "
- "ladies "
- "were "
- "inferior "
- to men; it
- " was that "
- "they were "
- different.
- " Their "
- "mission "
- "was to "
- "inspire "
- "others to "
- achievemen
- "t rather "
- "than to "
- "achieve "
- themselves
- ".\n"
- Indirectly
- ", by means"
- " of tact "
- "and a "
- "spotless "
- "name, a "
- lady could
- " "
- accomplish
- " much. "
- But if she
- " rushed "
- "into the "
- "fray "
- "herself "
- "she would "
- "be first "
- "censured, "
- "then "
- "despised, "
- "and "
- "finally "
- "ignored. "
- "Poems had "
- "been "
- written to
- " "
- illustrate
- " this "
- "point.\n\n"
- "There is "
- "much that "
- "is "
- "immortal "
- "in this "
- "medieval "
- "lady. The "
- "dragons "
- "have gone,"
- " and so "
- "have the "
- "knights, "
- "but still "
- "she "
- lingers in
- " our midst"
- ". She "
- reigned in
- " many an "
- "early "
- "Victorian "
- "castle, "
- "and was "
- "Queen of "
- much early
- " Victorian"
- " song. "
- "It is "
- "sweet to "
- "protect "
- her in the
- " intervals"
- " of "
- "business, "
- "sweet to "
- "pay her "
- "honour "
- "when she "
- has cooked
- " our "
- "dinner "
- "well.\n"
- "But alas! "
- "the "
- "creature "
- "grows "
- degenerate
- ". In her "
- heart also
- " there are"
- " springing"
- " up "
- "strange "
- "desires. "
- She too is
- " enamoured"
- " of heavy "
- "winds, and"
- " vast "
- "panoramas,"
- " and green"
- " expanses "
- of the sea
- ". She has "
- marked the
- " kingdom "
- "of this "
- "world, how"
- " full it "
- "is of "
- "wealth, "
- and beauty
- ", and war—"
- "a radiant "
- "crust, "
- "built "
- around the
- " central "
- "fires, "
- "spinning "
- "towards "
- "the "
- "receding "
- "heavens. "
- "Men, "
- "declaring "
- "that she "
- "inspires "
- them to it
- ", move "
- "joyfully "
- "over the "
- "surface, "
- having the
- " most "
- delightful
- " meetings "
- with other
- " men, "
- "happy, not"
- " because "
- "they are "
- "masculine,"
- " but "
- "because "
- "they are "
- "alive. "
- Before the
- " show "
- "breaks up "
- "she would "
- "like to "
- "drop the "
- "august "
- "title of "
- "the "
- "Eternal "
- "Woman, and"
- " go there "
- "as her "
- transitory
- " self.\n\n"
- "Lucy does "
- "not stand "
- "for the "
- "medieval "
- "lady, who "
- was rather
- " an ideal "
- "to which "
- "she was "
- "bidden to "
- "lift her "
- "eyes when "
- "feeling "
- "serious. "
- "Nor has "
- "she any "
- "system of "
- "revolt. "
- "Here and "
- "there a "
- restrictio
- "n annoyed "
- "her "
- particular
- "ly, and "
- "she would "
- transgress
- " it, and "
- perhaps be
- " sorry "
- "that she "
- "had done "
- "so. This "
- "afternoon "
- "she was "
- peculiarly
- " restive. "
- "She would "
- "really "
- like to do
- " something"
- " of which "
- her well-
- "wishers "
- disapprove
- "d. As she "
- "might not "
- "go on the "
- "electric "
- "tram, she "
- "went to "
- "Alinari’s "
- "shop.\n\n"
- "There she "
- "bought a "
- photograph
- " of "
- Botticelli
- "’s “Birth "
- of Venus.”
- " Venus,\n"
- "being a "
- "pity, "
- spoilt the
- " picture, "
- "otherwise "
- "so "
- "charming, "
- "and Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "had "
- "persuaded "
- "her to do "
- without it

- "some of "
- "the "
- "Sistine "
- "frescoes "
- "and the "
- Apoxyomeno
- "s, were "
- "added to "
- "it. "
- She felt a
- " little "
- "calmer "
- "then, and "
- bought Fra

- Angelico’s
- " “"
- Coronation

- Giotto’s “
- "Ascension "
- "of St. "
- "John,” "
- some Della

- "and some "
- Guido Reni
- " Madonnas."
- " For her "
- "taste was "
- "catholic, "
- "and she "
- "extended "
- uncritical
- " approval "
- "to every "
- well-known
- " name.\n\n"
- But though
- " she spent"
- " nearly "
- seven lire
- ", the "
- "gates of "
- "liberty "
- "seemed "
- "still "
- "unopened. "
- "She was "
- "conscious "
- "of her "
- discontent
- "; it was "
- new to her
- " to be "
- "conscious "
- "of it. "
- “The world
- ",” she "
- "thought, “"
- "is "
- "certainly "
- "full of "
- "beautiful "
- "things, if"
- " only I "
- could come
- " across "
- "them.” "
- It was not
- " "
- surprising
- " that Mrs."

- "h "
- disapprove

- ", "
- "declaring "
- "that it "
- "always "
- "left her "
- "daughter "
- "peevish, "
- unpractica
- "l, and "

- "“Nothing "
- "ever "
- happens to
- " me,” she "
- "reflected,"
- " as she "
- "entered "
- the Piazza
- " Signoria "
- and looked
- " "
- nonchalant
- "ly at its "
- "marvels, "
- now fairly
- " familiar "
- "to her. "
- "The great "
- square was
- " in shadow"
- "; the "
- "sunshine "
- "had come "
- "too late "
- "to strike "
- "it. "
- "Neptune "
- "was "
- "already "
- unsubstant
- ial in the
- " twilight,"
- " half god,"
- "\n"
- half ghost
- ", and his "
- "fountain "
- "plashed "
- "dreamily "
- to the men
- " and "
- satyrs who
- " idled "
- "together "
- "on its "
- "marge. "
- The Loggia
- " showed as"
- " the "
- "triple "
- "entrance "
- "of a cave,"
- " wherein "
- "many a "
- "deity, "
- "shadowy, "
- "but "
- "immortal, "
- "looking "
- forth upon
- " the "
- "arrivals "
- "and "
- departures
- " of "
- "mankind. "
- It was the
- " hour of "
- unreality—
- "the hour, "
- "that is, "
- "when "
- unfamiliar
- " things "
- "are real. "
- "An older "
- "person at "
- "such an "
- "hour and "
- "in such a "
- "place "
- "might "
- think that
- " "
- sufficient
- " was "
- "happening "
- "to him, "
- "and rest "
- "content. "
- "Lucy "
- "desired "
- "more.\n\n"
- "She fixed "
- "her eyes "
- "wistfully "
- "on the "
- "tower of "
- the palace
- ", which "
- "rose out "
- "of the "
- "lower "
- "darkness "
- "like a "
- "pillar of "
- "roughened "
- "gold. "
- "It seemed "
- "no longer "
- "a tower, "
- "no longer "
- "supported "
- "by earth, "
- "but some "
- unattainab
- "le "
- "treasure "
- "throbbing "
- "in the "
- "tranquil "
- "sky. Its "
- brightness
- " "
- mesmerized
- " her,\n"
- "still "
- "dancing "
- before her
- " eyes when"
- " she bent "
- "them to "
- the ground
- " and "
- "started "
- "towards "
- "home.\n\n"
- "Then "
- "something "
- did happen
- ".\n\nTwo "
- "Italians "
- "by the "
- Loggia had
- " been "
- "bickering "
- "about a "
- "debt. "
- "“Cinque "
- "lire,” "
- "they had "
- "cried, “"
- "cinque "
- "lire!” "
- "They "
- sparred at
- " each "
- "other, and"
- " one of "
- "them was "
- "hit "
- "lightly "
- "upon the "
- "chest. "
- He frowned
- "; he bent "
- "towards "
- "Lucy with "
- "a look of "
- "interest, "
- "as if he "
- "had an "
- "important "
- "message "
- "for her. "
- "He opened "
- "his lips "
- to deliver
- " it, and a"
- " stream of"
- " red came "
- "out "
- "between "
- "them and "
- "trickled "
- "down his "
- "unshaven "
- "chin.\n\n"
- "That was "
- "all. "
- "A crowd "
- "rose out "
- "of the "
- "dusk. "
- "It hid "
- "this "
- extraordin
- "ary man "
- "from her, "
- "and bore "
- "him away "
- "to the "
- "fountain. "
- "Mr. "
- "George "
- "Emerson "
- "happened "
- "to be a "
- "few paces "
- "away, "
- looking at
- " her "
- across the
- " spot "
- "where the "
- "man had "
- "been. "
- "How very "
- "odd! "
- "Across "
- something.
- " Even as "
- she caught
- " sight of "
- "him he "
- "grew dim; "
- the palace
- " itself "
- "grew dim, "
- "swayed "
- "above her,"
- "\n"
- fell on to
- " her "
- "softly, "
- "slowly, "
- noiselessl
- "y, and the"
- " sky fell "
- "with it.\n\n"
- "She "
- "thought: “"
- "Oh, what "
- "have I "
- "done?”\n\n"
- "“Oh, what "
- "have I "
- "done?” "
- "she "
- "murmured, "
- and opened
- " her eyes."
- "\n\nGeorge "
- "Emerson "
- "still "
- "looked at "
- "her, but "
- not across
- " anything."
- " She had "
- complained
- " of "
- "dullness, "
- "and lo! "
- "one man "
- "was "
- "stabbed, "
- "and "
- "another "
- "held her "
- "in his "
- "arms.\n\n"
- "They were "
- sitting on
- " some "
- "steps in "
- the Uffizi
- " Arcade. "
- "He must "
- "have "
- "carried "
- "her. "
- "He rose "
- "when she "
- "spoke, and"
- " began to "
- "dust his "
- "knees. "
- "She "
- "repeated:"
- "\n\n"
- "“Oh, what "
- "have I "
- "done?”\n\n"
- "“You "
- fainted.”
- "\n\n“I—I am "
- very sorry
- ".”\n\n"
- "“How are "
- you now?”
- "\n\n"
- “Perfectly
- " well—"
- absolutely
- " well.” "
- "And she "
- "began to "
- "nod and "
- "smile.\n\n"
- "“Then let "
- "us come "
- "home. "
- There’s no
- " point in "
- "our "
- stopping.”
- "\n\nHe held "
- "out his "
- "hand to "
- "pull her "
- "up. She "
- "pretended "
- not to see
- " it. "
- "The cries "
- "from the "
- fountain—
- "they had "
- "never "
- ceased—
- "rang "
- "emptily. "
- "The whole "
- "world "
- "seemed "
- "pale and "
- "void of "
- "its "
- "original "
- "meaning.\n\n"
- "“How very "
- "kind you "
- have been!
- " I might "
- "have hurt "
- "myself "
- "falling. "
- "But now I "
- "am well. "
- "I can go "
- "alone, "
- thank you.
- "”\n\n"
- "His hand "
- "was still "
- extended.
- "\n\n“Oh, my "
- photograph
- "s!” she "
- "exclaimed "
- suddenly.
- "\n\n“What "
- photograph
- "s?”\n\n"
- "“I bought "
- "some "
- photograph
- "s at "
- Alinari’s.
- " I must "
- "have "
- "dropped "
- "them out "
- "there in "
- the square
- ".” "
- She looked
- " at him "
- cautiously
- ". "
- “Would you
- " add to "
- "your "
- "kindness "
- "by "
- "fetching "
- "them?”\n\n"
- "He added "
- "to his "
- "kindness. "
- As soon as
- " he had "
- turned his
- " back, "
- Lucy arose
- " with the "
- running of
- " a maniac "
- "and stole "
- "down the "
- "arcade "
- "towards "
- the Arno.
- "\n\n“Miss "
- Honeychurc
- "h!”\n\nShe "
- "stopped "
- "with her "
- "hand on "
- her heart.
- "\n\n"
- "“You sit "
- still; you
- " aren’t "
- "fit to go "
- home alone
- ".”\n\n"
- "“Yes, I am"
- ", thank "
- "you so "
- very much.
- "”\n\n"
- "“No, you "
- "aren’t. "
- "You’d go "
- "openly if "
- you were.”
- "\n\n"
- “But I had
- " rather—”"
- "\n\n“Then I "
- "don’t "
- fetch your
- " "
- photograph
- "s.”\n\n"
- "“I had "
- "rather be "
- "alone.”\n\n"
- "He said "
- imperiousl
- "y: “The "
- "man is "
- "dead—the "
- "man is "
- "probably "
- "dead; sit "
- "down till "
- "you are "
- "rested.” "
- "She was "
- bewildered
- ", and "
- obeyed him
- ". "
- “And don’t
- " move till"
- " I come "
- "back.”\n\n"
- "In the "
- "distance "
- "she saw "
- "creatures "
- with black
- " hoods, "
- "such as "
- "appear in "
- "dreams. "
- The palace
- " tower had"
- " lost the "
- reflection
- " of the "
- "declining "
- "day,\n"
- and joined
- " itself to"
- " earth. "
- How should
- " she talk "
- "to Mr. "
- "Emerson "
- "when he "
- "returned "
- "from the "
- "shadowy "
- "square? "
- "Again the "
- "thought "
- "occurred "
- "to her,\n"
- "“Oh, what "
- "have I "
- done?”—the
- " thought "
- "that she, "
- as well as
- " the dying"
- " man,\nhad "
- "crossed "
- "some "
- "spiritual "
- boundary.
- "\n\nHe "
- "returned, "
- "and she "
- "talked of "
- the murder
- ". Oddly "
- "enough, it"
- " was an "
- easy topic
- ". "
- "She spoke "
- "of the "
- "Italian "
- character;
- " she "
- "became "
- "almost "
- "garrulous "
- "over the "
- "incident "
- "that had "
- "made her "
- faint five
- " minutes "
- "before. "
- "Being "
- "strong "
- physically
- ", she soon"
- " overcame "
- the horror
- " of blood."
- " She rose "
- "without "
- "his "
- assistance
- ", and "
- "though "
- "wings "
- "seemed to "
- "flutter "
- inside her
- ",\n"
- she walked
- " firmly "
- "enough "
- "towards "
- "the Arno. "
- "There a "
- "cabman "
- "signalled "
- "to them; "
- "they "
- "refused "
- "him.\n\n"
- "“And the "
- "murderer "
- "tried to "
- "kiss him, "
- you say—
- "how very "
- "odd "
- "Italians "
- "are!—and "
- "gave "
- himself up
- " to the "
- "police! "
- "Mr. "
- "Beebe was "
- "saying "
- "that "
- "Italians "
- "know "
- everything
- ", but I "
- think they
- " are "
- "rather "
- "childish. "
- "When my "
- cousin and
- " I were at"
- " the Pitti"
- " yesterday"
- "—What was "
- "that?”\n\n"
- "He had "
- "thrown "
- "something "
- "into the "
- "stream.\n\n"
- "“What did "
- "you throw "
- "in?”\n\n"
- "“Things I "
- "didn’t "
- "want,” he "
- "said "
- "crossly.\n\n"
- "“Mr. "
- Emerson!”
- "\n\n“Well?”"
- "\n\n"
- “Where are
- " the "
- photograph
- "s?”\n\n"
- "He was "
- "silent.\n\n"
- “I believe
- " it was my"
- " "
- photograph
- s that you
- " threw "
- "away.”\n\n"
- "“I didn’t "
- "know what "
- to do with
- " them,” he"
- " cried, "
- "and his "
- "voice was "
- that of an
- " anxious "
- "boy. "
- "Her heart "
- "warmed "
- "towards "
- "him for "
- "the first "
- "time.\n"
- “They were
- " covered "
- with blood
- ". There! "
- "I’m glad "
- "I’ve told "
- "you; and "
- "all the "
- "time we "
- "were "
- "making "
- conversati
- "on I was "
- "wondering "
- what to do
- " with them"
- ".” "
- He pointed
- " down-"
- "stream. "
- "“They’ve "
- "gone.” "
- "The river "
- "swirled "
- "under the "
- "bridge, “I"
- " did mind "
- "them so, "
- and one is
- " so "
- "foolish, "
- "it seemed "
- "better "
- "that they "
- "should go "
- out to the
- " sea—I "
- don’t know
- "; I may "
- "just mean "
- "that they "
- frightened
- " me.” "
- "Then the "
- boy verged
- " into a "
- "man. “For "
- "something "
- tremendous
- " has "
- "happened; "
- "I must "
- "face it "
- "without "
- "getting "
- "muddled. "
- "It isn’t "
- "exactly "
- that a man
- " has died."
- "”\n\n"
- "Something "
- "warned "
- "Lucy that "
- "she must "
- stop him.
- "\n\n“It has "
- "happened,”"
- " he "
- "repeated, "
- "“and I "
- "mean to "
- "find out "
- what it is
- ".”\n\n“Mr. "
- Emerson—”
- "\n\n"
- "He turned "
- "towards "
- "her "
- "frowning, "
- "as if she "
- "had "
- "disturbed "
- "him in "
- "some "
- "abstract "
- "quest.\n\n"
- “I want to
- " ask you "
- "something "
- "before we "
- "go in.”\n\n"
- "They were "
- "close to "
- "their "
- "pension. "
- "She "
- "stopped "
- "and leant "
- her elbows
- " against "
- "the "
- parapet of
- " the "
- embankment
- ". He did "
- "likewise. "
- "There is "
- at times a
- " magic in "
- "identity "
- "of "
- "position; "
- "it is one "
- "of the "
- "things "
- "that have "
- "suggested "
- "to us "

- "She moved "
- her elbows
- " before "
- "saying:\n\n"
- "“I have "
- "behaved "
- ridiculous
- "ly.”\n\n"
- "He was "
- "following "
- "his own "

- "\n\n“I was "

- "“I nearly "

- "Since she "

- "Granted "

- "wished to "
- "misbehave,"
- " it was "
- "pleasant "
- "for them "
- to be able
- " to do so."
- " "
- "They were "
- "probably "
- "the only "
- "people "
- "enjoying "
- "the "
- expedition
- ". The "
- "carriage "
- swept with
- " agonizing"
- " jolts up "
- "through "
- the Piazza
- " of "
- "Fiesole "
- "and into "
- "the "
- Settignano
- " road.\n\n"
- "“Piano! "
- "piano!” "
- "said Mr. "
- "Eager, "
- "elegantly "
- waving his
- " hand over"
- " his head."
- "\n\n"
- "“Va bene, "
- "signore, "
- "va bene, "

- "crooned "
- the driver

- "whipped "
- his horses
- " up again."
- "\n\nNow Mr. "
- "Eager and "
- "Miss "
- "Lavish "
- "began to "
- "talk "
- "against "
- each other
- " on the "
- subject of
- " Alessio "
- Baldovinet
- "ti. "
- "Was he a "
- "cause of "
- "the "

- "he one of "

- "The other "
- "carriage "
- "was left "
- "behind.\n"
- "As the "
- "pace "
- "increased "
- "to a "
- gallop the
- " large, "
- slumbering
- " form of "
- "Mr.\n"
- "Emerson "
- was thrown
- " against "
- "the "
- "chaplain "
- "with the "
- regularity
- " of a "
- "machine.\n\n"
- "“Piano! "
- "piano!” "
- "said he, "
- "with a "
- "martyred "
- "look at "
- "Lucy.\n\n"
- "An extra "

- "Phaethon, "
- "who for "
- "some time "

- "A little "
- "scene "
- "ensued, "
- "which, as "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "said "
- afterwards
- ", was most"
- " "
- unpleasant
- ". "
- The horses
- " were "
- "stopped, "
- the lovers

- "down.\n\n"
- “She is my
- " sister,” "
- "said he, "
- "turning "
- "round on "
- "them with "
- "piteous "
- "eyes.\n\n"
- "Mr. "
- Eager took
- " the "
- trouble to
- " tell him "
- "that he "
- was a liar
- ".\n\n"
- "Phaethon "
- "hung down "
- "his head, "
- not at the
- " matter of"
- " the "
- accusation
- ", but at "
- its manner
- ". At this "
- "point Mr. "
- "Emerson, "
- "whom the "
- "shock of "
- "stopping "
- "had awoke,"
- " declared "
- "that the "
- "lovers "
- must on no
- " account "
- "be "
- "separated,"
- "\n"
- and patted
- " them on "
- "the back "
- to signify
- " his "
- "approval. "
- "And Miss "
- "Lavish,\n"
- "though "
- "unwilling "
- "to ally "
- "him, felt "
- "bound to "
- "support "
- "the cause "
- "of "
- Bohemianis
- "m.\n\n“Most "
- "certainly "
- "I would "
- "let them "

- "cried. "
- "“But I "

- "I have "
- "always "
- "flown in "
- "the face "
- "of the "
- convention

- "life. "
- "This is "
- "what _I_ "
- "call an "
- adventure.
- "”\n\n"
- "“We must "
- not submit
- ",” said Mr"
- ". Eager. "
- “I knew he
- " was "
- "trying it "
- "on. He is "
- "treating "
- "us as if "
- "we were a "
- "party of "
- "Cook’s "
- tourists.”
- "\n\n"
- “Surely no
- "!” "
- "said Miss "
- "Lavish, "
- her ardour
- " visibly "
- decreasing
- ".\n\n"
- "The other "
- "carriage "
- "had drawn "
- "up behind,"
- " and "
- "sensible "
- "Mr. Beebe "
- called out
- " that "
- after this
- " warning "
- the couple
- " would be "
- "sure to "
- "behave "
- themselves
- " properly."
- "\n\n“Leave "
- them alone
- ",” Mr. "
- "Emerson "
- begged the
- " chaplain,"
- " of whom "
- "he stood "
- in no awe.
- " “Do we "
- "find "
- "happiness "
- "so often "
- "that we "
- "should "
- "turn it "
- "off the "

- "there? "
- "To be "
- "driven by "
- "lovers—A "
- king might
- " envy us, "
- "and if we "
- "part them "
- "it’s more "
- "like "
- "sacrilege "
- "than "
- anything I
- " know.”\n\n"
- "Here the "
- "voice of "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "was heard "
- "saying "
- "that a "
- "crowd had "
- "begun to "
- "collect.\n\n"
- "Mr. "
- "Eager, who"
- " suffered "
- "from an "
- over-
- "fluent "
- "tongue "
- "rather "
- "than a "
- "resolute "
- "will, was "
- determined
- " to make "
- "himself "
- "heard. He "
- "addressed "

- "boulders "
- "to "
- "preserve "
- "it from "

- "In Mr. "
- "Eager’s "
- "mouth it "
- "resembled "
- nothing so
- " much as "
- "an acid "
- "whistling "
- "fountain "
- "which "
- "played "
- "ever "
- higher and
- " higher, "

- "and more "
- "shrilly, "

- "abruptly "
- "it was "

- "click.\n\n"
- “Signorina
- "!” "
- "said the "

- Why should

- "\n\n"
- “Signorina
- "!” echoed "
- Persephone
- " in her "
- "glorious "
- contralto.
- " She "
- pointed at
- " the other"
- " carriage."
- " Why?\n\n"
- "For a "
- moment the
- " two girls"
- " looked at"
- " each "
- "other. "
- "Then "
- Persephone
- " got down "
- "from the "

- "“Victory "

- "said Mr. "
- "Eager, "
- "smiting "
- "his hands "
- "together "
- "as the "
- "carriages "
- "started "
- "again.\n\n"
- “It is not

- " said Mr. "
- "Emerson. "
- "“It is "
- "defeat. "
- "You have "
- parted two
- " people "
- "who were "
- "happy.”\n\n"
- "Mr. "
- Eager shut
- " his eyes."
- " He was "
- obliged to
- " sit next "
- "to Mr. "
- "Emerson, "
- "but he "
- "would not "
- "speak to "
- "him. "
- "The old "
- "man was "
- "refreshed "
- "by sleep, "
- "and took "
- "up the "
- "matter "
- "warmly. "
- "He "
- "commanded "
- "Lucy to "
- agree with
- " him; he "
- "shouted "
- "for "
- support to
- " his son."
- "\n\n"
- "“We have "
- "tried to "

- "cannot be "

- "bargained "
- "to drive "

- We have no

- "Miss "
- "Lavish "
- "frowned. "
- It is hard
- " when a "
- person you
- " have "
- classed as
- " typically"
- " British "
- speaks out
- " of his "
- character.
- "\n\n“He was "

- “He jolted

- "“That I "

- "he is "

- " now.\n"
- "Can you "
- "wonder? "
- "He would "
- "like to "

- " And if I "

- " "
- frightened

- It doesn’t

- "Have you "

- Lorenzo de

- "\n\nMiss "
- "Lavish "
- bristled.
- "\n\n“Most "

- "Lorenzo, "
- "Duke of "
- "Urbino, or"

- "\n\n"
- "“The Lord "

- "Possibly "
- "he does "
- "know, for "
- I refer to
- " Lorenzo "

- He wrote a

- " heard "
- yesterday—
- which runs
- " like this"
- ": ‘Don’t "

- "fighting "
- "against "

- "Mr. Eager "
- "could not "

- "\n\n"
- "“Non fate "

- "\n\n"
- “The point

- "have "
- "warred "
- "with it. "
- "Look.” "
- He pointed
- " to the "
- Val d’Arno

- "was "
- "visible "
- "far below "

- "through "
- "the "

- "“Fifty "

- "Do you "
- "suppose "
- "there’s "
- "any "
- difference
- " between "
- "Spring in "
- nature and
- " Spring in"
- " man? "
- "But there "
- "we go, "
- "praising "
- "the one "
- "and "
- condemning
- " the other"
- " as "
- "improper, "
- "ashamed "
- "that the "
- "same laws "
- "work "
- "eternally "
- "through "
- "both.”\n\n"
- "No one "
- encouraged
- " him to "
- "talk. "
- "Presently "
- "Mr. "
- Eager gave
- " a signal "
- "for the "
- "carriages "
- "to stop "
- "and "
- marshalled
- " the party"
- " for their"
- " ramble on"
- " the hill."
- " A hollow "
- "like a "
- "great "
- amphitheat
- "re, full "
- "of "
- "terraced "
- "steps and "
- "misty "
- "olives, "
- "now lay "
- "between "
- "them and "
- "the "
- heights of
- " Fiesole, "
- "and the "
- "road, "
- "still "
- "following "
- "its curve,"
- " was about"
- " to sweep "
- "on to a "
- promontory
- " which "
- "stood out "
- "in the "
- "plain. "
- "It was "
- "this "
- promontory
- ", "
- uncultivat
- "ed,\nwet, "
- "covered "
- "with "
- bushes and
- " "
- occasional
- " trees, "
- "which had "
- caught the
- " fancy of "
- "Alessio "
- Baldovinet
- "ti nearly "
- "five "
- "hundred "
- "years "
- "before. "
- "He had "
- "ascended "
- "it, that "
- "diligent "
- and rather
- " obscure "
- "master, "
- "possibly "
- "with an "
- "eye to "
- "business, "
- "possibly "
- "for the "
- "joy of "
- ascending.
- " Standing "
- "there, he "
- "had seen "
- "that view "
- of the Val
- " d’Arno "
- "and "
- "distant "
- "Florence, "
- "which he "
- afterwards
- " had "
- introduced
- " not very "
- effectivel
- y into his
- " work. "
- "But where "
- "exactly "
- "had he "
- "stood? "
- "That was "
- "the "
- "question "
- "which Mr. "
- "Eager "
- "hoped to "
- solve now.
- " And Miss "
- "Lavish, "
- "whose "
- nature was
- " attracted"
- " by "
- "anything "
- problemati
- "cal, had "
- "become "
- "equally "
- enthusiast
- "ic.\n\n"
- "But it is "
- "not easy "
- "to carry "
- "the "
- "pictures "
- of Alessio
- " "
- Baldovinet
- ti in your
- " head, "
- "even if "
- "you have "
- remembered
- " to look "
- "at them "
- "before "
- "starting.\n"
- "And the "
- "haze in "
- the valley
- " increased"
- " the "
- difficulty
- " of the "
- "quest.\n\n"
- "The party "
- "sprang "
- about from
- " tuft to "
- "tuft of "
- "grass, "
- "their "
- anxiety to
- " keep "
- "together "
- being only
- " equalled "
- "by their "
- "desire to "
- "go "
- "different "
- directions
- ". Finally "
- they split
- " into "
- "groups. "
- Lucy clung
- " to Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "and Miss "
- "Lavish; "
- "the "
- "Emersons "
- "returned "
- "to hold "
- "laborious "
- "converse "
- "with the "
- "drivers; "
- "while the "
- "two "
- "clergymen,"
- " who were "
- "expected "
- "to have "
- "topics in "
- "common, "
- "were left "
- "to each "
- "other.\n\n"
- "The two "
- "elder "
- "ladies "
- soon threw
- " off the "
- "mask. "
- "In the "
- "audible "
- "whisper "
- "that was "
- "now so "
- "familiar "
- "to Lucy "
- they began
- " to "
- "discuss, "
- "not "
- "Alessio "
- Baldovinet
- "ti, but "
- the drive.
- " Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "had asked "
- "Mr. "
- "George "
- "Emerson "
- "what his "
- profession
- " was, and "
- "he had "
- answered “
- "the "
- "railway.” "
- "She was "
- very sorry
- " that she "
- "had asked "
- "him. "
- She had no
- " idea that"
- " it would "
- "be such a "
- "dreadful "
- "answer, or"
- " she would"
- " not have "
- asked him.
- " Mr. "
- "Beebe had "
- turned the
- " "
- conversati
- "on so "
- "cleverly, "
- "and she "
- hoped that
- " the young"
- " man was "
- "not very "
- "much hurt "
- "at her "
- asking him
- ".\n\n“The "
- "railway!” "
- "gasped "
- "Miss "
- "Lavish. "
- "“Oh, but I"
- " shall die"
- "! "
- "Of course "
- it was the

- " "
- "She could "
- "not "
- "control "

- "Appearing "

- Cecil must

- " He was "
- "medieval. "
- "Like a "

- "statue. "
- "Tall and "
- "refined, "
- "with "
- "shoulders "
- "that "
- "seemed "
- "braced "
- "square by "
- "an effort "
- "of the "
- "will, and "
- "a head "
- "that was "
- "tilted a "
- "little "
- "higher "
- "than the "
- "usual "
- "level of "
- "vision, he"
- " resembled"
- " those "
- fastidious
- " saints "
- "who guard "
- "the "
- portals of
- " a French "
- cathedral.
- "\nWell "
- "educated, "
- "well "
- "endowed, "
- "and not "
- "deficient "
- physically
- ", he "
- "remained "
- "in the "
- "grip of a "
- "certain "
- devil whom
- " the "
- "modern "
- "world "
- "knows as "
- self-
- consciousn
- "ess, and "
- "whom the "
- "medieval, "
- "with "
- "dimmer "
- "vision,\n"
- worshipped
- " as "
- asceticism
- ". "
- "A Gothic "
- "statue "
- "implies "
- "celibacy, "
- "just as a "
- "Greek "
- "statue "
- "implies "
- "fruition, "
- "and "
- "perhaps "
- "this was "
- "what Mr. "
- "Beebe "
- "meant. "
- And Freddy

- "ignored "
- "history "
- "and art, "
- "perhaps "
- "meant the "
- "same when "
- "he failed "
- to imagine
- " Cecil "
- "wearing "
- "another "
- "fellow’s "
- "cap.\n\n"
- "Mrs. "
- Honeychurc

- " letter on"
- " the "
- "writing "

- "moved "
- "towards "
- "her young "

- "“Oh, Cecil"

- "“oh, Cecil"

- "They "
- "stared at "

- anxiously.
- "\n\n"
- "“She has "
- "accepted "
- "me,” he "
- "said, and "
- "the sound "
- "of the "
- "thing in "
- "English "
- "made him "
- "flush and "
- smile with
- " pleasure,"
- " and look "
- more human
- ".\n\n"
- "“I am so "
- "glad,” "
- "said Mrs. "
- Honeychurc
- "h, while "
- "Freddy "
- "proffered "
- "a hand "
- "that was "
- "yellow "
- "with "
- chemicals.
- " They "
- "wished "
- "that they "

- "Italian, "
- "for our "

- " approval "
- "and of "

- "We are "

- "“Welcome "

- "“We "
- "mothers—” "
- "simpered "
- "Mrs. "
- Honeychurc
- "h, and "
- "then "
- "realized "
- "that she "
- "was "
- "affected, "

- bombastic—
- "all the "

- " hated "
- "most. "
- "Why could "
- she not be
- " Freddy, "
- "who stood "
- "stiff in "
- the middle

- "room;\n"
- "looking "

- "almost "
- handsome?
- "\n\n“I say, "
- "Lucy!” "
- "called "
- "Cecil, for"

- conversati
- "on seemed "
- "to flag.\n\n"
- "Lucy rose "
- "from the "
- "seat. "
- "She moved "
- across the
- " lawn and "
- "smiled in "
- "at them, "
- just as if
- " she was "
- "going to "
- "ask them "
- "to play "
- "tennis. "
- "Then she "
- "saw her "
- "brother’s "
- "face. "
- "Her lips "
- "parted, "
- "and she "
- "took him "
- "in her "
- "arms. "
- "He said, “"
- Steady on!
- "”\n\n“Not a "
- "kiss for "
- "me?” "
- "asked her "
- "mother.\n\n"
- "Lucy "
- kissed her

- “Would you
- " take them"
- " into the "
- garden and
- " tell Mrs."
- " "
- Honeychurc
- "h all "

- " Cecil "
- suggested.
- " “And I’d "

- "and tell "
- my mother.
- "”\n\n“We go "

- "” said "
- "Freddy, as"

- " orders.\n\n"
- "“Yes, you "
- "go with "
- "Lucy.”\n\n"
- "They "
- "passed "
- "into the "
- "sunlight. "
- "Cecil "
- "watched "
- them cross
- " the "
- "terrace,\n"
- "and "
- "descend "
- "out of "
- "sight by "
- the steps.
- " "
- They would
- " descend—"
- "he knew "
- their ways
- "—past the "
- "shrubbery,"
- " and past "
- the tennis
- "-lawn and "
- the dahlia
- "-bed,\n"
- until they
- " reached "
- "the "
- "kitchen "
- "garden, "
- "and there,"
- " in the "
- "presence "
- "of the "
- "potatoes "
- "and the "
- "peas, the "
- "great "
- "event "
- "would be "
- discussed.
- "\n\nSmiling "
- indulgentl
- "y, he lit "
- "a "
- "cigarette,"
- " and "
- "rehearsed "
- the events
- " that had "
- "led to "
- "such a "
- "happy "
- conclusion
- ".\n\nHe had "
- known Lucy
- " for "
- "several "
- "years, but"
- " only as a"
- " "
- commonplac
- e girl who
- " happened "
- "to be "
- "musical. "
- "He could "
- "still "
- "remember "
- "his "
- depression
- " that "
- "afternoon "
- "at Rome, "
- "when she "
- "and her "
- "terrible "
- "cousin "
- "fell on "
- him out of
- " the blue,"
- " and "
- "demanded "
- "to be "
- "taken to "
- "St. "
- "Peter’s. "
- "That day "
- "she had "
- "seemed a "
- "typical "
- tourist—
- "shrill, "
- "crude, and"
- " gaunt "
- "with "
- "travel. "
- "But Italy "
- "worked "
- "some "
- "marvel in "
- "her. "
- "It gave "
- "her light,"
- " and—which"
- " he held "
- "more "
- precious—
- "it gave "
- her shadow
- ". Soon he "
- "detected "
- "in her a "
- "wonderful "
- reticence.
- " She was "
- "like a "
- "woman of "
- "Leonardo "
- da Vinci’s
- ", whom we "
- "love not "
- "so much "
- "for "
- herself as
- " for the "
- "things "
- "that she "
- "will not "
- "tell us.\n"
- The things
- " are "
- "assuredly "
- "not of "
- this life;
- " no woman "
- "of "
- Leonardo’s
- " could "
- "have "
- "anything "
- "so vulgar "
- as a “
- "story.” "
- "She did "
- "develop "
- "most "
- wonderfull
- "y day by "
- "day.\n\n"
- "So it "
- "happened "
- "that from "
- patronizin
- g civility
- " he had "
- "slowly "
- "passed if "
- "not to "
- "passion, "
- "at least "
- "to a "
- "profound "
- uneasiness
- ". "
- Already at
- " Rome he "
- had hinted
- " to her "
- "that they "
- "might be "
- "suitable "
- "for each "
- "other. "
- "It had "
- "touched "
- "him "
- "greatly "
- "that she "
- "had not "
- "broken "
- "away at "
- "the "
- suggestion
- ". Her "
- "refusal "
- "had been "
- "clear and "
- "gentle; "
- after it—
- "as the "
- "horrid "
- "phrase "
- "went—she "
- "had been "
- "exactly "
- "the same "
- "to him as "
- "before. "
- "Three "
- "months "
- "later, on "
- the margin
- " of Italy,"
- " among the"
- " flower-"
- "clad Alps,"
- " he had "
- "asked her "
- "again in "
- "bald, "
- traditiona
- l language
- ". She "
- "reminded "
- "him of a "
- "Leonardo "
- "more than "
- "ever; her "
- "sunburnt "
- "features "
- "were "
- "shadowed "
- "by "
- "fantastic "
- "rock;\n"
- "at his "
- "words she "
- had turned
- " and stood"
- " between "
- "him and "
- "the light "
- "with "
- immeasurab
- "le plains "
- behind her
- ". "
- "He walked "
- "home with "
- "her "
- "unashamed,"
- "\nfeeling "
- not at all
- " like a "
- "rejected "
- "suitor. "
- The things
- " that "
- "really "
- "mattered "
- "were "
- unshaken.
- "\n\n"
- "So now he "
- "had asked "
- "her once "
- "more, and,"
- " clear and"
- " gentle as"
- " ever, she"
- " had "
- "accepted "
- "him, "
- "giving no "
- "coy "
- "reasons "
- "for her "
- "delay, but"
- " simply "
- "saying "
- "that she "
- "loved him "
- "and would "
- "do her "
- "best to "
- "make him "
- "happy. "
- His mother
- ", too, "
- "would be "
- "pleased; "
- "she had "
- counselled
- " the step;"
- " he must "
- "write her "
- "a long "
- "account.\n\n"
- "Glancing "
- "at his "
- "hand, in "
- "case any "
- "of "
- "Freddy’s "
- "chemicals "
- "had come "
- "off on it,"
- " he moved "
- "to the "
- "writing "
- "table. "
- "There he "
- "saw “Dear "
- "Mrs. "
- "Vyse,”\n"
- "followed "
- "by many "
- "erasures. "
- "He "
- "recoiled "
- "without "
- "reading "
- "any more, "
- "and after "
- "a little "
- hesitation
- " sat down "
- "elsewhere,"
- " and "
- "pencilled "
- "a note on "
- his knee.
- "\n\nThen he "
- "lit "
- "another "
- "cigarette,"
- " which did"
- " not seem "
- "quite as "
- "divine as "
- "the first,"
- " and "
- considered

- "With that "

- "have been "
- "a "
- successful

- " the trail"
- " of "
- "Tottenham "
- Court Road
- " was upon "

- He did not

- " "
- temptation
- "s never "
- "lay in "
- "that "
- direction;
- " but he "
- "worried "
- "about it "
- "none the "

- It was his
- " own fault"
- " that she "
- "was "
- discussing
- " him with "
- his mother

- "who they "
- "were, "

- "with him, "
- "and so he "

- "\n\n"
- "At tea a "

- " took "

- "They were "
- "gone some "

- "When they "

- “Do you go

- "“Oh, now "

- "”\n\n"
- "“But my "
- "point is "
- that their
- " whole "
- "attitude "
- "is wrong. "
- "An "
- engagement
- "—horrid "
- "word in "
- "the first "
- place—is a

- "Yet the "
- "smirking "
- "old women,"
- " however "

- The spirit

- "on earth. "
- "To Cecil "
- "and Lucy "
- "it "
- "promised "
- "something "
- "quite "
- different—
- "personal "
- "love. "
- "Hence "
- "Cecil’s "
- irritation
- " and "
- "Lucy’s "
- "belief "
- "that his "
- irritation
- " was just."
- "\n\n“How "

- "she said. "
- "“Couldn’t "
- "you have "

- "“It makes "

- "\n\n"
- "“Oh, I see"

- "She leant "

- "Lucy was "

- "quick "
- "enough to "
- "detect "

- She missed

- "He had "

- "All he "

- "But it is "
- "such an "

- "Chapter "
- "XIV How "
- Lucy Faced
- " the "
- "External "
- "Situation "
- "Bravely\n\n\n"
- "Of course "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "accepted. "
- "And, "
- equally of
- " course, "
- "she felt "
- "sure that "
- "she would "
- "prove a "
- "nuisance, "
- and begged
- " to be "
- "given an "
- "inferior "
- spare room
- —something
- " with no "
- "view, "
- "anything. "
- "Her love "
- "to Lucy. "
- "And,\n"
- equally of
- " course, "
- "George "
- "Emerson "
- could come
- " to tennis"
- " on the "
- "Sunday "
- "week.\n\n"
- Lucy faced
- " the "
- "situation "
- "bravely, "
- "though, "
- "like most "
- "of us, she"
- " only "
- "faced the "
- "situation "
- "that "
- encompasse
- "d her. "
- "She never "
- "gazed "
- "inwards. "
- "If at "
- "times "
- "strange "
- "images "
- "rose from "
- the depths
- ", she put "
- "them down "
- to nerves.
- " "
- When Cecil
- " brought "
- "the "
- "Emersons "
- "to Summer "
- "Street, it"
- " had upset"
- " her "
- "nerves. "
- "Charlotte "
- "would "
- burnish up
- " past "
- foolishnes
- "s, and "
- this might
- " upset her"
- " nerves. "
- "She was "
- nervous at
- " night. "
- "When she "
- "talked to "
- George—
- "they met "
- "again "
- "almost "
- immediatel
- "y at the "
- Rectory—
- "his voice "
- "moved her "
- "deeply, "
- "and she "
- "wished to "
- "remain "
- "near him. "
- "How "
- "dreadful "
- "if she "
- "really "
- "wished to "
- "remain "
- "near him! "
- "Of course,"
- " the wish "
- was due to
- " nerves, "
- which love
- " to play "
- "such "
- "perverse "
- "tricks "
- "upon us. "
- "Once she "
- "had "
- "suffered "
- from “
- "things "
- "that came "
- "out of "
- "nothing "
- "and meant "
- she didn’t
- " know what"
- ".” "
- "Now Cecil "
- "had "
- "explained "
- psychology
- " to her "
- "one wet "
- "afternoon,"
- " and all "
- "the "
- "troubles "
- "of youth "
- "in an "
- "unknown "
- "world "
- "could be "
- dismissed.
- "\n\nIt is "
- "obvious "
- enough for
- " the "
- "reader to "
- "conclude, "
- “She loves
- " young "
- "Emerson.” "
- "A reader "
- "in Lucy’s "
- "place "
- "would not "
- "find it "
- "obvious. "
- "Life is "
- "easy to "
- "chronicle,"
- " but "
- bewilderin
- "g to "
- "practice, "
- "and we "
- welcome “
- "nerves”\n"
- "or any "
- "other "
- shibboleth
- " that will"
- " cloak our"
- " personal "
- "desire. "
- "She loved "
- "Cecil; "
- "George "
- "made her "
- "nervous; "
- "will the "
- "reader "
- explain to
- " her that "
- "the "
- "phrases "
- "should "
- "have been "
- reversed?
- "\n\nBut the "
- "external "
- situation—
- "she will "
- "face that "
- "bravely.\n\n"
- "The "
- meeting at
- " the "
- "Rectory "
- had passed
- " off well "
- "enough. "
- "Standing "
- between Mr

- "Beebe and "
- "Cecil, she"
- " had made "
- "a few "
- "temperate "
- "allusions "
- "to Italy,\n"
- and George
- " had "
- "replied. "
- "She was "
- anxious to
- " show that"
- " she was "
- "not shy,\n"
- "and was "
- "glad that "
- he did not
- " seem shy "
- "either.\n\n"
- "“A nice "
- "fellow,” "
- "said Mr. "
- "Beebe "
- afterwards
- " “He will "
- "work off "
- "his "
- "crudities "
- "in time. "
- "I rather "
- "mistrust "
- "young men "
- "who slip "
- "into life "
- gracefully
- ".”\n\n"
- "Lucy said,"
- " “He seems"
- " in better"

- "He laughs "
- "more.”\n\n"
- "“Yes,” "
- "replied "
- "the "
- clergyman.
- " “He is "

- "”\n\n"
- "That was "
- "all. "
- "But, as "
- "the week "
- "wore on, "
- "more of "

- due at the

- No one was
- " at home "

- "Cecil and "

- "little "
- "Minnie "

- "upon the "

- "\n\n"
- "“I shall "

- "said Miss "
- "Bartlett, "
- "who kept "

- "“Our "

- "“Let’s "

- “I believe

- h uneasily
- ".\n\n“Our "

- "was told "
- "that we "

- " further. "
- "“He "
- thought we
- " should be"
- " artistic."
- " He is "

- "“And I "
- "wonder "

- "” He "

- "“Oh, stop "
- "now you "
- "have come,"
- "” said "
- "Lucy "
- "lightly. "
- "She must "
- "avoid "
- "censuring "
- "Cecil. "
- For it was
- " on Cecil "
- "that the "
- "little "
- "episode "
- "turned,\n"
- though his
- " name was "
- "never "
- mentioned.
- "\n\n"
- “So George
- " says. "
- "He says "
- "that the "
- Miss Alans
- " must go "
- "to the "
- "wall. "
- "Yet it "
- "does seem "
- so unkind.
- "”\n\n"
- "“There is "
- "only a "
- "certain "
- "amount of "
- "kindness "
- "in the "
- "world,” "
- "said "
- "George,\n"
- "watching "
- "the "
- "sunlight "
- "flash on "
- the panels
- " of the "
- "passing "
- carriages.
- "\n\n“Yes!” "
- "exclaimed "
- "Mrs. "
- Honeychurc
- "h. "
- "“That’s "
- "exactly "
- what I say
- ". Why all "
- "this "
- "twiddling "
- "and "
- "twaddling "
- "over two "
- Miss Alans
- "?”\n\n"
- "“There is "
- "a certain "
- "amount of "
- "kindness, "
- "just as "
- there is a
- " certain "
- "amount of "
- "light,” he"
- " continued"
- " in "

- "tones. "
- “We cast a
- " shadow on"
- " something"
- " wherever "
- "we stand, "
- "and it is "
- "no good "
- "moving "
- from place
- " to place "
- "to save "
- "things; "
- "because "
- the shadow
- " always "
- "follows. "
- "Choose a "

- "where you "

- "harm—yes, "
- "choose a "
- "place "
- "where you "
- "won’t do "
- "very much "
- "harm, and "
- "stand in "

- " you are "
- "worth, "

- "”\n\n"
- "“Oh, Mr. "
- "Emerson, I"
- " see "
- "you’re "
- "clever!”\n\n"
- "“Eh—?”\n\n"
- "“I see "
- "you’re "
- "going to "
- be clever.
- " "
- I hope you
- " didn’t go"
- " behaving "
- "like that "
- "to poor "

- "George’s "
- "eyes "
- "laughed, "
- "and Lucy "
- "suspected "
- "that he "
- "and her "
- "mother "
- "would get "
- "on rather "
- "well.\n\n"
- "“No, I "
- "didn’t,” "

- "“He "

- "It is his "

- "Mr. "

- He thanked
- " her, but "
- "the walk "
- "sounded "
- rather far
- ; he could
- " only "
- "potter "
- "about in "

- ".\n\n"
- She turned
- " to George"
- ": “And "
- "then he "
- "wants to "
- "give up "
- "his house "
- "to the "
- Miss Alans
- ".”\n\n"
- "“I know,” "
- "said "
- "George, "
- "and put "
- "his arm "
- "round his "
- "father’s "
- "neck. The "
- "kindness "
- "that Mr. "
- "Beebe and "
- "Lucy had "
- "always "
- "known to "
- "exist in "
- "him came "
- "out "
- "suddenly, "
- "like "
- "sunlight "
- touching a
- " vast "
- landscape—
- a touch of
- " the "
- "morning "
- "sun? She "
- remembered
- " that in "
- "all his "
- perversiti
- "es he had "
- "never "
- "spoken "
- "against "

- "\n\nMiss "
- "Bartlett "
- approached
- ".\n\n"
- "“You know "

- "\n\n“Yes, "

- "said the "
- "old man, "

- "as if he "
- would come
- " out of "
- the garden
- " to meet "
- "the lady. "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "promptly "
- "got into "
- "the "
- "victoria. "
- "Thus "
- entrenched

- "emitted a "

- It was the

- "Bertolini "
- "again, the"
- " dining-"

- " the "
- "decanters "
- "of water "
- "and wine.\n"
- It was the
- " old, old "
- "battle of "
- "the room "
- "with the "
- "view.\n\n"
- George did
- " not "
- respond to
- " the bow. "
- "Like any "
- "boy, he "
- "blushed "
- "and was "
- "ashamed; "
- "he knew "
- "that the "
- "chaperon "

- "He said: “"
- "I—I’ll "
- come up to
- " tennis if"
- " I can "
- "manage it,"
- ” and went
- " into the "
- "house. "
- "Perhaps "
- "anything "
- "that he "
- "did would "
- "have "
- "pleased "
- "Lucy, but "
- "his "
- awkwardnes
- "s went "
- "straight "
- "to her "
- heart; men
- " were not "
- gods after
- " all, but "
- "as human "
- "and as "
- "clumsy as "
- "girls; "
- "even men "
- "might "
- "suffer "
- "from "
- unexplaine
- "d desires,"
- " and need "
- "help. "
- "To one of "
- "her "
- upbringing
- ", and of "
- "her "
- destinatio
- "n, the "
- "weakness "
- of men was
- " a truth "

- "had "
- "surmised "

- "George "
- "threw her "

- " River "
- "Arno.\n\n"
- "“George, "

- "“George "

- "”\n\nLucy "
- caught her
- " cousin’s "
- "eye. "
- "Something "
- "in its "
- "mute "
- "appeal "
- "made her "
- "reckless. "
- "“Yes,” she"
- " said, "
- "raising "
- "her voice,"
- " “I do "

- "will.” "
- "Then she "
- "went to "

- "and "
- "murmured, "
- "“The old "

- " been told"
- "; I knew "
- it was all

- "Mrs. "

- Satisfacto
- ry that Mr

- "had not "
- "been told "
- "of the "
- "Florence "
- "escapade; "
- yet Lucy’s
- " spirits "
- should not
- " have "
- "leapt up "
- "as if she "
- "had "
- "sighted "
- "the "
- "ramparts "
- of heaven.
- " "
- Satisfacto

- surely she
- " greeted "
- "it with "
- disproport

- ". All the "
- "way home "
- the horses
- "’ hoofs "
- "sang a "
- "tune to "
- "her: “He "
- "has not "
- "told, he "
- "has not "
- "told.” "
- "Her brain "
- "expanded "
- the melody
- ": “He has "
- "not told "
- his father
- "—to whom "
- "he tells "
- all things
- ". "
- It was not
- " an "
- "exploit. "
- He did not
- " laugh at "
- "me when I "
- had gone.”
- " "
- She raised
- " her hand "
- "to her "
- "cheek. "
- "“He does "
- "not love "
- "me. No. "
- "How "
- "terrible "
- if he did!
- "\n"
- But he has
- " not told."
- " He will "
- not tell.”
- "\n\n"
- She longed
- " to shout "
- "the words:"
- " “It is "
- all right.
- " It’s a "
- "secret "
- between us
- " two for "
- "ever. "
- Cecil will
- " never "
- "hear.” "
- "She was "
- "even glad "
- "that Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- "had made "
- "her "
- "promise "
- "secrecy, "
- "that last "
- "dark "
- evening at
- " Florence,"
- " when they"
- " had knelt"
- " packing "
- "in his "
- "room. "
- The secret

- "little, "
- "was "
- "guarded.\n\n"
- Only three
- " English "
- "people "
- knew of it
- " in the "
- "world. "
- "Thus she "
- interprete
- d her joy.
- " She "
- "greeted "
- Cecil with
- " unusual "
- "radiance, "
- "because "
- "she felt "
- "so safe. "
- "As he "
- helped her
- " out of "
- "the "
- "carriage, "
- "she said:"
- "\n\n“The "
- "Emersons "

- "so nice. "
- "George "
- "Emerson "
- "has "
- "improved "
- enormously
- ".”\n\n"
- "“How are "
- "my "

- " asked "
- "Cecil, who"
- " took no "
- "real "
- "interest "
- "in them,\n"
- "and had "
- long since
- " forgotten"
- " his "
- resolution
- " to bring "
- "them to "
- "Windy "
- Corner for
- " "
- educationa
- l purposes
- ".\n\n"
- “Protégés!
- "” she "
- "exclaimed "
- "with some "
- "warmth. "
- "For the "
- "only "
- relationsh
- "ip which "
- "Cecil "
- "conceived "
- was feudal
- ": that of "
- "protector "
- "and "
- protected.
- " "
- "He had no "
- glimpse of
- " the "
- comradeshi
- "p after "
- "which the "
- "girl’s "
- "soul "
- "yearned.\n\n"
- “You shall

- "yourself "
- "how your "

- "George "
- Emerson is
- " coming up"
- " this "
- afternoon.
- " He is a "
- "most "
- interestin
- "g man to "
- "talk to. "
- Only don’t
- "—” She "
- "nearly "
- "said, “"
- "Don’t "
- "protect "
- "him.” "
- "But the "
- "bell was "
- "ringing "
- "for lunch,"
- " and, as "
- "often "
- "happened, "
- "Cecil had "
- "paid no "
- "great "
- "attention "
- "to her "
- "remarks. "
- "Charm, not"
- " argument,"
- " was to be"
- " her forte"
- ".\n\n"
- "Lunch was "
- a cheerful
- " meal. "
- "Generally "
- "Lucy was "
- "depressed "
- "at meals. "
- "Some one "
- "had to be "
- soothed—
- "either "
- "Cecil or "
- "Miss "
- "Bartlett "
- or a Being
- " not "
- visible to
- " the "
- mortal eye
- "—a Being "
- "who "
- "whispered "
- "to her "
- "soul: “It "
- "will not "

- In January
- " you must "
- "go to "
- "London to "
- "entertain "
- "the "
- grandchild

- " men.” "
- But to-day
- " she felt "
- "she had "
- received a
- " guarantee"
- ". "
- Her mother
- " would "
- always sit
- " there, "
- "her "
- "brother "
- "here. "
- "The sun, "
- "though it "
- "had moved "
- "a little "
- "since the "
- "morning,\n"
- "would "
- "never be "
- "hidden "
- behind the
- " western "
- "hills. "
- "After "
- "luncheon "
- they asked
- " her to "
- "play. "
- "She had "
- "seen "
- "Gluck’s "
- "Armide "
- "that year,"
- " and "
- "played "
- "from "
- memory the
- " music of "
- "the "
- "enchanted "
- garden—the
- " music to "
- "which "
- "Renaud "
- approaches
- ", beneath "
- "the light "
- "of an "
- "eternal "
- "dawn, the "
- music that
- " never "
- "gains, "
- "never "
- "wanes, but"
- " ripples "
- "for ever "
- "like the "
- "tideless "
- "seas of "
- fairyland.
- " "
- Such music
- " is not "
- "for the "
- "piano, and"
- " her "
- "audience "
- "began to "
- "get "
- "restive, "
- "and Cecil,"
- " sharing "
- "the "
