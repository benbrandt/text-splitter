- "CHORUS.\nTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene,"
- "From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands unclean."
- "From forth the fatal loins of these two foes\nA pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;"

- "[_Exit._]"
- "ACT I\n\nSCENE I. A public place.\n\n Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers."
- "SAMPSON.\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.\n\nGREGORY.\nNo, for then we should be colliers."
- "SAMPSON.\nI mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw."
- "GREGORY.\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar."
- "SAMPSON.\nI strike quickly, being moved.\n\nGREGORY.\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike."
- "SAMPSON.\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me."
- "GREGORY.\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou"
- "art moved, thou runn’st away."
- "SAMPSON.\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand."
- I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
- "GREGORY.\nThat shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall."
- "SAMPSON.\nTrue, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to"
- "the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and\nthrust his maids to the wall."
- "GREGORY.\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men."
- "SAMPSON.\n’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the"
- "men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.\n\nGREGORY.\nThe heads of the maids?"
- "SAMPSON.\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense\nthou wilt."
- "GREGORY.\nThey must take it in sense that feel it."
- "SAMPSON.\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a\npretty piece of flesh."
- "GREGORY.\n’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John."
- "Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.\n\n Enter Abram and Balthasar."
- "SAMPSON.\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\n\nGREGORY.\nHow? Turn thy back and run?"
- "SAMPSON.\nFear me not.\n\nGREGORY.\nNo, marry; I fear thee!"
- "SAMPSON.\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin."
- "GREGORY.\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list."
- "SAMPSON.\nNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to\nthem if they bear it."
- "ABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON.\nI do bite my thumb, sir."
- "ABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON.\nIs the law of our side if I say ay?"
- "GREGORY.\nNo.\n\nSAMPSON.\nNo sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir."
- "GREGORY.\nDo you quarrel, sir?\n\nABRAM.\nQuarrel, sir? No, sir."
- "SAMPSON.\nBut if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.\n\nABRAM.\nNo better."
- "SAMPSON.\nWell, sir.\n\n Enter Benvolio.\n\nGREGORY.\nSay better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen."
- "SAMPSON.\nYes, better, sir.\n\nABRAM.\nYou lie."
- "SAMPSON.\nDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.\n\n [_They fight._]"
- "BENVOLIO.\nPart, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.\n\n [_Beats down their swords._]"
- Enter Tybalt.
- "TYBALT.\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\nTurn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death."
- "BENVOLIO.\nI do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,\nOr manage it to part these men with me."
- "TYBALT.\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:"
- "Have at thee, coward.\n\n [_They fight._]\n\n Enter three or four Citizens with clubs."
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!"
- "Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\n\n Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet."
- "CAPULET.\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?"
- "CAPULET.\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me."
- "Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.\n\nMONTAGUE.\nThou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go."
- "LADY MONTAGUE.\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\n\n Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants."
- "PRINCE.\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—"
- "Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage"
- "With purple fountains issuing from your veins,\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands"
- "Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince."
- "Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,"
- "Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens"
- "Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,"
- "Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,"
- "Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\nFor this time all the rest depart away:"
- "You, Capulet, shall go along with me,\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,"
- "To know our farther pleasure in this case,\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place."
- "Once more, on pain of death, all men depart."
- "[_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\n Citizens and Servants._]"
- "MONTAGUE.\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nHere were the servants of your adversary\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach."
- "I drew to part them, in the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,"
- "Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,"
- "Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows"
- "Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part."
- "LADY MONTAGUE.\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray."
- "BENVOLIO.\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,"
- "A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore"
- "That westward rooteth from this city side,\nSo early walking did I see your son."
- "Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood."
- "I, measuring his affections by my own,\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,"
- "Being one too many by my weary self,\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,"
- And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
- "MONTAGUE.\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,"
- "Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun"
- "Should in the farthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,"
- "Away from light steals home my heavy son,\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,"
- "Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night."
- "Black and portentous must this humour prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove."
- "BENVOLIO.\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\n\nMONTAGUE.\nI neither know it nor can learn of him."
- "BENVOLIO.\nHave you importun’d him by any means?"
- "MONTAGUE.\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,"
- "Is to himself—I will not say how true—\nBut to himself so secret and so close,"
- "So far from sounding and discovery,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm"
- "Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun."
- "Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\nWe would as willingly give cure as know."
- Enter Romeo.
- "BENVOLIO.\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied."
- "MONTAGUE.\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,"
- "[_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nGood morrow, cousin.\n\nROMEO.\nIs the day so young?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nBut new struck nine."
- "ROMEO.\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?"
- "ROMEO.\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nIn love?\n\nROMEO.\nOut."
- "BENVOLIO.\nOf love?\n\nROMEO.\nOut of her favour where I am in love."
- "BENVOLIO.\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof."
- "ROMEO.\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!"
- "Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all."
- "Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!"
- "O anything, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!"
- "Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!"
- "Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this."
- "Dost thou not laugh?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nNo coz, I rather weep.\n\nROMEO.\nGood heart, at what?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAt thy good heart’s oppression."
- "ROMEO.\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,"
- "Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown"
- "Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;"
- "Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:"
- "What is it else? A madness most discreet,\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz."
- "[_Going._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nSoft! I will go along:\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong."
- "ROMEO.\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\nThis is not Romeo, he’s some other where."
- "BENVOLIO.\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\n\nROMEO.\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who."
- "ROMEO.\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,\nA word ill urg’d to one that is so ill."
- "In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nI aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d."
- "ROMEO.\nA right good markman, and she’s fair I love."
- "BENVOLIO.\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit."
- "ROMEO.\nWell, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit\nWith Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;"
- "And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,\nFrom love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d."
- "She will not stay the siege of loving terms\nNor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,"
- "Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\nO she’s rich in beauty, only poor"
- "That when she dies, with beauty dies her store."
- "BENVOLIO.\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?"
- "ROMEO.\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\nFor beauty starv’d with her severity,"
- "Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,"
- "To merit bliss by making me despair.\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow"
- "Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBe rul’d by me, forget to think of her."
- "ROMEO.\nO teach me how I should forget to think."
- "BENVOLIO.\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\nExamine other beauties."
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis the way\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more."
- "These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;"
- "He that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost."
- "Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note"
- "Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?\nFarewell, thou canst not teach me to forget."
- "BENVOLIO.\nI’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Street."
- "Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant."
- "CAPULET.\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,"
- For men so old as we to keep the peace.
- "PARIS.\nOf honourable reckoning are you both,\nAnd pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long."
- "But now my lord, what say you to my suit?"
- "CAPULET.\nBut saying o’er what I have said before.\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world,"
- "She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\nLet two more summers wither in their pride"
- "Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\n\nPARIS.\nYounger than she are happy mothers made."
- "CAPULET.\nAnd too soon marr’d are those so early made.\nThe earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,"
- "She is the hopeful lady of my earth:\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,"
- "My will to her consent is but a part;\nAnd she agree, within her scope of choice"
- "Lies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustom’d feast,"
- "Whereto I have invited many a guest,\nSuch as I love, and you among the store,"
- "One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\nAt my poor house look to behold this night"
- "Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel"
- "When well apparell’d April on the heel\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight"
- "Among fresh female buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,"
- "And like her most whose merit most shall be:\nWhich, on more view of many, mine, being one,"
- "May stand in number, though in reckoning none.\nCome, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about"
- Through fair Verona; find those persons out
- "Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,"
- "My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.\n\n [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]"
- "SERVANT.\nFind them out whose names are written here! It is written that the"
- "shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the"
- "fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to"
- "find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what"
- "names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good\ntime!"
- Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,\nOne pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;"
- "Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\nOne desperate grief cures with another’s languish:"
- "Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die."
- "ROMEO.\nYour plantain leaf is excellent for that.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nFor what, I pray thee?"
- "ROMEO.\nFor your broken shin.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?"
- "ROMEO.\nNot mad, but bound more than a madman is:\nShut up in prison, kept without my food,"
- "Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.\n\nSERVANT.\nGod gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, mine own fortune in my misery."
- "SERVANT.\nPerhaps you have learned it without book.\nBut I pray, can you read anything you see?"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, If I know the letters and the language.\n\nSERVANT.\nYe say honestly, rest you merry!"
- "ROMEO.\nStay, fellow; I can read.\n\n [_He reads the letter._]"
- "_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\nCounty Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;"
- "The lady widow of Utruvio;\nSignior Placentio and his lovely nieces;"
- "Mercutio and his brother Valentine;\nMine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;"
- "My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;"
- Lucio and the lively Helena. _
- "A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?\n\nSERVANT.\nUp."
- "ROMEO.\nWhither to supper?\n\nSERVANT.\nTo our house.\n\nROMEO.\nWhose house?\n\nSERVANT.\nMy master’s."
- "ROMEO.\nIndeed I should have ask’d you that before."
- "SERVANT.\nNow I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,"
- "and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a\ncup of wine. Rest you merry."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAt this same ancient feast of Capulet’s\nSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;"
- "With all the admired beauties of Verona.\nGo thither and with unattainted eye,"
- "Compare her face with some that I shall show,\nAnd I will make thee think thy swan a crow."
- "ROMEO.\nWhen the devout religion of mine eye\nMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;"
- "And these who, often drown’d, could never die,\nTransparent heretics, be burnt for liars."
- "One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\nNe’er saw her match since first the world begun."
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,\nHerself pois’d with herself in either eye:"
- "But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d\nYour lady’s love against some other maid"
- "That I will show you shining at this feast,\nAnd she shall scant show well that now shows best."
- "ROMEO.\nI’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,\nBut to rejoice in splendour of my own."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nNurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me."
- "NURSE.\nNow, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,\nI bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!"
- "God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\nJULIET.\nHow now, who calls?"
- "NURSE.\nYour mother.\n\nJULIET.\nMadam, I am here. What is your will?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThis is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,"
- "We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,\nI have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel."
- "Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.\n\nNURSE.\nFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nShe’s not fourteen."
- "NURSE.\nI’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,\nAnd yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,"
- "She is not fourteen. How long is it now\nTo Lammas-tide?\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nA fortnight and odd days."
- "NURSE.\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,\nCome Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen."
- "Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—\nWere of an age. Well, Susan is with God;"
- "She was too good for me. But as I said,\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;"
- "That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\n’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;"
- "And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day:"
- "For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;"
- "My lord and you were then at Mantua:\nNay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,"
- "When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,"
- "To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!\nShake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,"
- "To bid me trudge.\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;"
- "For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood\nShe could have run and waddled all about;"
- "For even the day before she broke her brow,\nAnd then my husband,—God be with his soul!"
- "A was a merry man,—took up the child:\n‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?"
- "Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,"
- "The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.\nTo see now how a jest shall come about."
- "I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,"
- "I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;"
- "And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace."
- "NURSE.\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,\nTo think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;"
- "And yet I warrant it had upon it brow\nA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;"
- "A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\n‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?"
- "Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’."
- "JULIET.\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I."
- "NURSE.\nPeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace"
- "Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:"
- "And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nMarry, that marry is the very theme\nI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,"
- "How stands your disposition to be married?\n\nJULIET.\nIt is an honour that I dream not of."
- "NURSE.\nAn honour! Were not I thine only nurse,\nI would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, think of marriage now: younger than you,\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,"
- "Are made already mothers. By my count\nI was your mother much upon these years"
- "That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love."
- "NURSE.\nA man, young lady! Lady, such a man\nAs all the world—why he’s a man of wax."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nVerona’s summer hath not such a flower."
- "NURSE.\nNay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhat say you, can you love the gentleman?"
- "This night you shall behold him at our feast;\nRead o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,"
- "And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.\nExamine every married lineament,"
- "And see how one another lends content;\nAnd what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,"
- "Find written in the margent of his eyes.\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,"
- "To beautify him, only lacks a cover:\nThe fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride"
- "For fair without the fair within to hide.\nThat book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,"
- "That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess,"
- "By having him, making yourself no less.\n\nNURSE.\nNo less, nay bigger. Women grow by men."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?"
- "JULIET.\nI’ll look to like, if looking liking move:\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye"
- "Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\n\n Enter a Servant."
- "SERVANT.\nMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady"
- "asked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity."
- "I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWe follow thee."
- "[_Exit Servant._]\n\nJuliet, the County stays.\n\nNURSE.\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Street."
- "Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;\n Torch-bearers and others."
- "ROMEO.\nWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\nOr shall we on without apology?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThe date is out of such prolixity:\nWe’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,"
- "Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,\nScaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;"
- "Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\nAfter the prompter, for our entrance:"
- "But let them measure us by what they will,\nWe’ll measure them a measure, and be gone."
- "ROMEO.\nGive me a torch, I am not for this ambling;\nBeing but heavy I will bear the light."
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance."
- "ROMEO.\nNot I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,\nWith nimble soles, I have a soul of lead"
- So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
- "MERCUTIO.\nYou are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,\nAnd soar with them above a common bound."
- "ROMEO.\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\nTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound,"
- "I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\nUnder love’s heavy burden do I sink."
- "MERCUTIO.\nAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;\nToo great oppression for a tender thing."
- "ROMEO.\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,\nToo rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn."
- "MERCUTIO.\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;"
- "Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down."
- "Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]\nA visor for a visor. What care I"
- "What curious eye doth quote deformities?\nHere are the beetle-brows shall blush for me."
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in\nBut every man betake him to his legs."
- "ROMEO.\nA torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels;"
- "For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,\nI’ll be a candle-holder and look on,"
- "The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done."
- "MERCUTIO.\nTut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:"
- "If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire\nOr save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest"
- "Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.\n\nROMEO.\nNay, that’s not so."
- "MERCUTIO.\nI mean sir, in delay\nWe waste our lights in vain, light lights by day."
- "Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\nBut ’tis no wit to go.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWhy, may one ask?"
- "ROMEO.\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAnd so did I.\n\nROMEO.\nWell what was yours?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThat dreamers often lie.\n\nROMEO.\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true."
- "MERCUTIO.\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes"
- "In shape no bigger than an agate-stone\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,"
- "Drawn with a team of little atomies\nOver men’s noses as they lie asleep:"
- "Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;"
- "Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;\nThe collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;"
- "Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;\nHer waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,"
- "Not half so big as a round little worm\nPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:"
- "Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,"
- "Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night"
- "Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;"
- "O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;"
- "O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;\nO’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,"
- "Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:"
- "Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;"
- "And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,\nTickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,"
- "Then dreams he of another benefice:\nSometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,"
- "And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,"
- "Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;"
- "And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab"
- "That plats the manes of horses in the night;\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,"
- "Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,"
- "That presses them, and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage:\nThis is she,—"
- "ROMEO.\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,\nThou talk’st of nothing."
- "MERCUTIO.\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,"
- "Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,"
- "And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,"
- "And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his side to the dew-dropping south."
- "BENVOLIO.\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late."
- "ROMEO.\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars,"
- "Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night’s revels; and expire the term"
- "Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death."
- "But he that hath the steerage of my course\nDirect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!"
- "BENVOLIO.\nStrike, drum.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House."
- Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.
- "FIRST SERVANT.\nWhere’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?"
- He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nWhen good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they"
- "unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing."
- "FIRST SERVANT.\nAway with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the"
- "plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,"
- "let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan!\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nAy, boy, ready."
- "FIRST SERVANT.\nYou are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the\ngreat chamber."
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nWe cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and"
- "the longer liver take all.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers."
- "CAPULET.\nWelcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes"
- "Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.\nAh my mistresses, which of you all"
- "Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,\nShe I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?"
- "Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\nThat I have worn a visor, and could tell"
- "A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,\nSuch as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,"
- "You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.\nA hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls."
- "[_Music plays, and they dance._]"
- "More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,\nAnd quench the fire, the room is grown too hot."
- "Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.\nNay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,"
- "For you and I are past our dancing days;\nHow long is’t now since last yourself and I\nWere in a mask?"
- "CAPULET’S COUSIN.\nBy’r Lady, thirty years."
- "CAPULET.\nWhat, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:\n’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,"
- "Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,\nSome five and twenty years; and then we mask’d."
- "CAPULET’S COUSIN.\n’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;\nHis son is thirty."
- "CAPULET.\nWill you tell me that?\nHis son was but a ward two years ago."
- "ROMEO.\nWhat lady is that, which doth enrich the hand\nOf yonder knight?\n\nSERVANT.\nI know not, sir."
- "ROMEO.\nO, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\nIt seems she hangs upon the cheek of night"
- "As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;\nBeauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!"
- "So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\nAs yonder lady o’er her fellows shows."
- "The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,\nAnd touching hers, make blessed my rude hand."
- "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\nFor I ne’er saw true beauty till this night."
- "TYBALT.\nThis by his voice, should be a Montague.\nFetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave"
- "Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,\nTo fleer and scorn at our solemnity?"
- "Now by the stock and honour of my kin,\nTo strike him dead I hold it not a sin."
- "CAPULET.\nWhy how now, kinsman!\nWherefore storm you so?"
- "TYBALT.\nUncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\nA villain that is hither come in spite,"
- "To scorn at our solemnity this night.\n\nCAPULET.\nYoung Romeo, is it?"
- "TYBALT.\n’Tis he, that villain Romeo."
- "CAPULET.\nContent thee, gentle coz, let him alone,\nA bears him like a portly gentleman;"
- "And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\nTo be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth."
- "I would not for the wealth of all the town\nHere in my house do him disparagement."
- "Therefore be patient, take no note of him,\nIt is my will; the which if thou respect,"
- "Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\nAn ill-beseeming semblance for a feast."
- "TYBALT.\nIt fits when such a villain is a guest:\nI’ll not endure him."
- "CAPULET.\nHe shall be endur’d.\nWhat, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;"
- "Am I the master here, or you? Go to.\nYou’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,"
- "You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!\nYou will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!"
- "TYBALT.\nWhy, uncle, ’tis a shame."
- "CAPULET.\nGo to, go to!\nYou are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?"
- "This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.\nYou must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time."
- "Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:\nBe quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!"
- "I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts."
- "TYBALT.\nPatience perforce with wilful choler meeting"
- "Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\nI will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,"
- "Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "ROMEO.\n[_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest hand"
- "This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,\nMy lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand"
- To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
- "JULIET.\nGood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this;"
- "For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss."
- "ROMEO.\nHave not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
- "JULIET.\nAy, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
- "ROMEO.\nO, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:"
- "They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
- "JULIET.\nSaints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake."
- "ROMEO.\nThen move not while my prayer’s effect I take.\nThus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d."
- "[_Kissing her._]\n\nJULIET.\nThen have my lips the sin that they have took."
- "ROMEO.\nSin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!\nGive me my sin again."
- "JULIET.\nYou kiss by the book.\n\nNURSE.\nMadam, your mother craves a word with you."
- "ROMEO.\nWhat is her mother?"
- "NURSE.\nMarry, bachelor,\nHer mother is the lady of the house,"
- "And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.\nI nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal."
- "I tell you, he that can lay hold of her\nShall have the chinks."
- "ROMEO.\nIs she a Capulet?\nO dear account! My life is my foe’s debt."
- "BENVOLIO.\nAway, be gone; the sport is at the best.\n\nROMEO.\nAy, so I fear; the more is my unrest."
- "CAPULET.\nNay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,\nWe have a trifling foolish banquet towards."
- "Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;\nI thank you, honest gentlemen; good night."
- "More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed.\nAh, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,"
- "I’ll to my rest.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._]"
- "JULIET.\nCome hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?\n\nNURSE.\nThe son and heir of old Tiberio."
- "JULIET.\nWhat’s he that now is going out of door?\n\nNURSE.\nMarry, that I think be young Petruchio."
- "JULIET.\nWhat’s he that follows here, that would not dance?\n\nNURSE.\nI know not."
- "JULIET.\nGo ask his name. If he be married,\nMy grave is like to be my wedding bed."
- "NURSE.\nHis name is Romeo, and a Montague,\nThe only son of your great enemy."
- "JULIET.\nMy only love sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!"
- "Prodigious birth of love it is to me,\nThat I must love a loathed enemy."
- "NURSE.\nWhat’s this? What’s this?\n\nJULIET.\nA rhyme I learn’d even now\nOf one I danc’d withal."
- "[_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]\n\nNURSE.\nAnon, anon!\nCome let’s away, the strangers all are gone."
- "[_Exeunt._]"
- "ACT II\n\n Enter Chorus."
- "CHORUS.\nNow old desire doth in his deathbed lie,\nAnd young affection gapes to be his heir;"
- "That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,\nWith tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair."
- "Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,\nAlike bewitched by the charm of looks;"
- "But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,\nAnd she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:"
- "Being held a foe, he may not have access\nTo breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;"
- "And she as much in love, her means much less\nTo meet her new beloved anywhere."
- "But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,\nTempering extremities with extreme sweet."
- "[_Exit._]\n\nSCENE I. An open place adjoining Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "ROMEO.\nCan I go forward when my heart is here?\nTurn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out."
- "[_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]\n\n Enter Benvolio and Mercutio."
- "BENVOLIO.\nRomeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!"
- "MERCUTIO.\nHe is wise,\nAnd on my life hath stol’n him home to bed."
- "BENVOLIO.\nHe ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:\nCall, good Mercutio."
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, I’ll conjure too.\nRomeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover!"
- "Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,\nSpeak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;"
- "Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;\nSpeak to my gossip Venus one fair word,"
- "One nickname for her purblind son and heir,\nYoung Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim"
- "When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.\nHe heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;"
- "The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.\nI conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,"
- "By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,\nBy her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,"
- "And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,\nThat in thy likeness thou appear to us."
- "BENVOLIO.\nAn if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him."
- "MERCUTIO.\nThis cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him\nTo raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,"
- "Of some strange nature, letting it there stand\nTill she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;"
- "That were some spite. My invocation\nIs fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,"
- I conjure only but to raise up him.
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, he hath hid himself among these trees\nTo be consorted with the humorous night."
- "Blind is his love, and best befits the dark."
- "MERCUTIO.\nIf love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.\nNow will he sit under a medlar tree,"
- "And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit\nAs maids call medlars when they laugh alone."
- "O Romeo, that she were, O that she were\nAn open-arse and thou a poperin pear!"
- "Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.\nThis field-bed is too cold for me to sleep."
- "Come, shall we go?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nGo then; for ’tis in vain\nTo seek him here that means not to be found."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "ROMEO.\nHe jests at scars that never felt a wound.\n\n Juliet appears above at a window."
- "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"
- "Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief,"
- "That thou her maid art far more fair than she.\nBe not her maid since she is envious;"
- "Her vestal livery is but sick and green,\nAnd none but fools do wear it; cast it off."
- "It is my lady, O it is my love!\nO, that she knew she were!"
- "She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\nHer eye discourses, I will answer it."
- "I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,"
- "Having some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return."
- "What if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,"
- "As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright"
- "That birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand."
- "O that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek.\n\nJULIET.\nAy me."
- "ROMEO.\nShe speaks.\nO speak again bright angel, for thou art"
- "As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven"
- "Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him"
- "When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air."
- "JULIET.\nO Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name."
- "Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I’ll no longer be a Capulet."
- "ROMEO.\n[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"
- "JULIET.\n’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague."
- "What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part"
- "Belonging to a man. O be some other name.\nWhat’s in a name? That which we call a rose"
- "By any other name would smell as sweet;\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,"
- "Retain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,"
- "And for thy name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself."
- "ROMEO.\nI take thee at thy word.\nCall me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;"
- Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
- "JULIET.\nWhat man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night\nSo stumblest on my counsel?"
- "ROMEO.\nBy a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,"
- "Because it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word."
- "JULIET.\nMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\nOf thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound."
- "Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\n\nROMEO.\nNeither, fair maid, if either thee dislike."
- "JULIET.\nHow cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?"
- "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,"
- If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
- "ROMEO.\nWith love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,"
- "And what love can do, that dares love attempt:\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me."
- "JULIET.\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee."
- "ROMEO.\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,"
- "And I am proof against their enmity.\n\nJULIET.\nI would not for the world they saw thee here."
- "ROMEO.\nI have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here."
- "My life were better ended by their hate\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love."
- "JULIET.\nBy whose direction found’st thou out this place?"
- "ROMEO.\nBy love, that first did prompt me to enquire;\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes."
- "I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far\nAs that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,"
- I should adventure for such merchandise.
- "JULIET.\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek"
- "For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.\nFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny"
- "What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.\nDost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,"
- "And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,"
- "They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully."
- "Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,"
- "So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;"
- "And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:\nBut trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true"
- "Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,"
- "But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,\nMy true-love passion; therefore pardon me,"
- "And not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered."
- "ROMEO.\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—"
- "JULIET.\nO swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,"
- "Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\n\nROMEO.\nWhat shall I swear by?"
- "JULIET.\nDo not swear at all.\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,"
- "Which is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I’ll believe thee.\n\nROMEO.\nIf my heart’s dear love,—"
- "JULIET.\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract tonight;"
- "It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be"
- "Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.\nThis bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,"
- "May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\nGood night, good night. As sweet repose and rest"
- "Come to thy heart as that within my breast.\n\nROMEO.\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
- "JULIET.\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?"
- "ROMEO.\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine."
- "JULIET.\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\nAnd yet I would it were to give again."
- "ROMEO.\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?"
- "JULIET.\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have;"
- "My bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,"
- "The more I have, for both are infinite.\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu."
- "[_Nurse calls within._]\nAnon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true."
- "Stay but a little, I will come again.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "ROMEO.\nO blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,"
- "Too flattering sweet to be substantial.\n\n Enter Juliet above."
- "JULIET.\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,"
- "Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,\nBy one that I’ll procure to come to thee,"
- "Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay"
- "And follow thee my lord throughout the world.\n\nNURSE.\n[_Within._] Madam."
- "JULIET.\nI come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,\nI do beseech thee,—\n\nNURSE.\n[_Within._] Madam."
- "JULIET.\nBy and by I come—\nTo cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.\nTomorrow will I send."
- "ROMEO.\nSo thrive my soul,—\n\nJULIET.\nA thousand times good night.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "ROMEO.\nA thousand times the worse, to want thy light."
- "Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,"
- "But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\n\n [_Retiring slowly._]"
- "Re-enter Juliet, above."
- "JULIET.\nHist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again."
- "Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,"
- "And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\nWith repetition of my Romeo’s name."
- "ROMEO.\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name.\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,"
- "Like softest music to attending ears.\n\nJULIET.\nRomeo.\n\nROMEO.\nMy nyas?"
- "JULIET.\nWhat o’clock tomorrow\nShall I send to thee?\n\nROMEO.\nBy the hour of nine."
- "JULIET.\nI will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back."
- "ROMEO.\nLet me stand here till thou remember it."
- "JULIET.\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRemembering how I love thy company."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\nForgetting any other home but this."
- "JULIET.\n’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,"
- "That lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,"
- "And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty."
- "ROMEO.\nI would I were thy bird."
- "JULIET.\nSweet, so would I:\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing."
- "Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "ROMEO.\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast."
- "Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.\nThe grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,"
- "Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;\nAnd darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels"
- "From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheels\nHence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,"
- "His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell."
- Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,"
- "The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,\nI must upfill this osier cage of ours"
- "With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\nThe earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;"
- "What is her burying grave, that is her womb:\nAnd from her womb children of divers kind"
- "We sucking on her natural bosom find.\nMany for many virtues excellent,"
- "None but for some, and yet all different.\nO, mickle is the powerful grace that lies"
- "In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.\nFor naught so vile that on the earth doth live"
- "But to the earth some special good doth give;\nNor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,"
- "Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\nVirtue itself turns vice being misapplied,"
- "And vice sometime’s by action dignified.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "Within the infant rind of this weak flower\nPoison hath residence, and medicine power:"
- "For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;"
- "Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\nTwo such opposed kings encamp them still"
- "In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;\nAnd where the worser is predominant,"
- "Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.\n\nROMEO.\nGood morrow, father."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBenedicite!\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?"
- "Young son, it argues a distemper’d head\nSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed."
- "Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,\nAnd where care lodges sleep will never lie;"
- "But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain\nDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign."
- "Therefore thy earliness doth me assure\nThou art uprous’d with some distemperature;"
- "Or if not so, then here I hit it right,\nOur Romeo hath not been in bed tonight."
- "ROMEO.\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?"
- "ROMEO.\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\nI have forgot that name, and that name’s woe."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThat’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?"
- "ROMEO.\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,"
- "Where on a sudden one hath wounded me\nThat’s by me wounded. Both our remedies"
- "Within thy help and holy physic lies.\nI bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,"
- My intercession likewise steads my foe.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;"
- Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
- "ROMEO.\nThen plainly know my heart’s dear love is set\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet."
- "As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\nAnd all combin’d, save what thou must combine"
- "By holy marriage. When, and where, and how\nWe met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,"
- "I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\nThat thou consent to marry us today."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHoly Saint Francis! What a change is here!"
- "Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\nSo soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies"
- "Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine"
- "Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,"
- "To season love, that of it doth not taste.\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,"
- "Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit"
- "Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,"
- "Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\nAnd art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,"
- "Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.\n\nROMEO.\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\n\nROMEO.\nAnd bad’st me bury love."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNot in a grave\nTo lay one in, another out to have."
- "ROMEO.\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow."
- The other did not so.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, she knew well\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell."
- "But come young waverer, come go with me,\nIn one respect I’ll thy assistant be;"
- "For this alliance may so happy prove,\nTo turn your households’ rancour to pure love."
- "ROMEO.\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Street."
- Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
- "MERCUTIO.\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man."
- "MERCUTIO.\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so"
- that he will sure run mad.
- "BENVOLIO.\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s\nhouse."
- "MERCUTIO.\nA challenge, on my life.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nRomeo will answer it."
- "MERCUTIO.\nAny man that can write may answer a letter."
- "BENVOLIO.\nNay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared."
- "MERCUTIO.\nAlas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black"
- "eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart"
- "cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter\nTybalt?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhy, what is Tybalt?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of"
- "compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,"
- "and proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in"
- "your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;"
- "a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,"
- "the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nThe what?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners"
- "of accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good"
- "whore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should"
- "be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,"
- "these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot"
- "sit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "BENVOLIO.\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!"
- "MERCUTIO.\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou"
- "fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to"
- "his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to"
- "berhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings"
- "and harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior"
- "Romeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You"
- gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
- "ROMEO.\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?"
- "ROMEO.\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as"
- mine a man may strain courtesy.
- "MERCUTIO.\nThat’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\nin the hams."
- "ROMEO.\nMeaning, to curtsy.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThou hast most kindly hit it."
- "ROMEO.\nA most courteous exposition.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy."
- "ROMEO.\nPink for flower.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nRight.\n\nROMEO.\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered."
- "MERCUTIO.\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,"
- "that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\nwearing, solely singular."
- "ROMEO.\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!"
- "MERCUTIO.\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint."
- "ROMEO.\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match."
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast"
- "more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my"
- whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
- "ROMEO.\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\ngoose."
- "MERCUTIO.\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\n\nROMEO.\nNay, good goose, bite not."
- "MERCUTIO.\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nO here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\nell broad."
- "ROMEO.\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves"
- thee far and wide a broad goose.
- "MERCUTIO.\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou"
- "sociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as"
- "well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,"
- "that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nStop there, stop there."
- "MERCUTIO.\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair."
- "BENVOLIO.\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large."
- "MERCUTIO.\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the"
- "whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\nlonger.\n\n Enter Nurse and Peter."
- "ROMEO.\nHere’s goodly gear!\nA sail, a sail!\n\nMERCUTIO.\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\n\nNURSE.\nPeter!"
- "PETER.\nAnon.\n\nNURSE.\nMy fan, Peter."
- "MERCUTIO.\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face."
- "NURSE.\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman."
- "NURSE.\nIs it good-den?"
- "MERCUTIO.\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\nprick of noon."
- "NURSE.\nOut upon you! What a man are you?"
- "ROMEO.\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar."
- "NURSE.\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,"
- can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
- "ROMEO.\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him"
- "than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\nfault of a worse."
- "NURSE.\nYou say well.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely."
- "NURSE.\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you."
- "BENVOLIO.\nShe will endite him to some supper.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat hast thou found?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something"
- "stale and hoar ere it be spent.\n[_Sings._]\n    An old hare hoar,\n    And an old hare hoar,"
- "Is very good meat in Lent;\n    But a hare that is hoar\n    Is too much for a score"
- "When it hoars ere it be spent.\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither."
- "ROMEO.\nI will follow you.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady."
- "[_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]"
- "NURSE.\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\nropery?"
- "ROMEO.\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak"
- more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
- "NURSE.\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier"
- "than he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those"
- that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of
- "his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\nuse me at his pleasure!"
- "PETER.\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should"
- "quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another"
- "man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side."
- "NURSE.\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy"
- "knave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me"
- "enquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first"
- "let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they"
- "say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the"
- "gentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with"
- "her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\nvery weak dealing."
- "ROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\nthee,—"
- "NURSE.\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\nbe a joyful woman."
- "ROMEO.\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me."
- "NURSE.\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\ngentlemanlike offer."
- "ROMEO.\nBid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,"
- "And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains."
- "NURSE.\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\n\nROMEO.\nGo to; I say you shall."
- "NURSE.\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,"
- "And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy"
- "Must be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;"
- "Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.\n\nNURSE.\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir."
- "ROMEO.\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?"
- "NURSE.\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?"
- "ROMEO.\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel."
- "NURSE.\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a"
- "little prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that"
- "would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a"
- "toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that"
- "Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she"
- looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and
- "Romeo begin both with a letter?\n\nROMEO.\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R."
- "NURSE.\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins"
- "with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,"
- "of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\n\nROMEO.\nCommend me to thy lady."
- "NURSE.\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\n\n [_Exit Romeo._]\n\nPETER.\nAnon.\n\nNURSE.\nBefore and apace."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Juliet."
- "JULIET.\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,\nIn half an hour she promised to return."
- "Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,"
- "Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:"
- "Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings."
- "Now is the sun upon the highmost hill\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve"
- "Is three long hours, yet she is not come.\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,"
- "She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me."
- "But old folks, many feign as they were dead;\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead."
- Enter Nurse and Peter.
- "O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away."
- "NURSE.\nPeter, stay at the gate.\n\n [_Exit Peter._]"
- "JULIET.\nNow, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?"
- "Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\nIf good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news"
- By playing it to me with so sour a face.
- "NURSE.\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!"
- "JULIET.\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:"
- "Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak."
- "NURSE.\nJesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am\nout of breath?"
- "JULIET.\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?"
- "The excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse."
- "Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance."
- "Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?"
- "NURSE.\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man."
- "Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his"
- "leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though"
- "they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the"
- "flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy"
- "ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?"
- "JULIET.\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?"
- "NURSE.\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces."
- "My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about"
- To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
- "JULIET.\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well."
- "Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?"
- "NURSE.\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,"
- "And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?"
- "JULIET.\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest."
- "‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\n‘Where is your mother?’"
- "NURSE.\nO God’s lady dear,\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow."
- "Is this the poultice for my aching bones?\nHenceforward do your messages yourself."
- "JULIET.\nHere’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?\n\nNURSE.\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?"
- "JULIET.\nI have."
- "NURSE.\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife."
- "Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,\nThey’ll be in scarlet straight at any news."
- "Hie you to church. I must another way,\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love"
- "Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.\nI am the drudge, and toil in your delight;"
- "But you shall bear the burden soon at night.\nGo. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell."
- "JULIET.\nHie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell."
- Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not."
- "ROMEO.\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy"
- "That one short minute gives me in her sight.\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,"
- "Then love-devouring death do what he dare,\nIt is enough I may but call her mine."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThese violent delights have violent ends,"
- "And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey"
- "Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite."
- "Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow."
- Enter Juliet.
- "Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint."
- "A lover may bestride the gossamers\nThat idles in the wanton summer air"
- "And yet not fall; so light is vanity.\n\nJULIET.\nGood even to my ghostly confessor."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both."
- "JULIET.\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much."
- "ROMEO.\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more"
- "To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue"
- "Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both\nReceive in either by this dear encounter."
- "JULIET.\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament."
- "They are but beggars that can count their worth;\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,"
- I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,"
- "For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "ACT III\n\nSCENE I. A public Place.\n\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants."
- "BENVOLIO.\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,"
- "And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring."
- "MERCUTIO.\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of"
- "a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no"
- need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
- "drawer, when indeed there is no need.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAm I like such a fellow?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as"
- "soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAnd what to?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would"
- "kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a"
- hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel
- "with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou"
- hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
- "Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy"
- head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast
- "quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath"
- wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall
- out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
- "another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\ntutor me from quarrelling!"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee"
- "simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThe fee simple! O simple!"
- "Enter Tybalt and others.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets."
- "MERCUTIO.\nBy my heel, I care not."
- "TYBALT.\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you."
- "MERCUTIO.\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\nword and a blow."
- "TYBALT.\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\noccasion."
- "MERCUTIO.\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?"
- "TYBALT.\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo."
- "MERCUTIO.\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of"
- "us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s"
- "that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\nEither withdraw unto some private place,"
- "And reason coldly of your grievances,\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us."
- "MERCUTIO.\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze."
- "I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "TYBALT.\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man."
- "MERCUTIO.\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery."
- "Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\nYour worship in that sense may call him man."
- "TYBALT.\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain."
- "ROMEO.\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage"
- "To such a greeting. Villain am I none;\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not."
- "TYBALT.\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw."
- "ROMEO.\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise"
- "Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender"
- "As dearly as mine own, be satisfied."
- "MERCUTIO.\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away."
- "Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\n\nTYBALT.\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to"
- "make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest"
- of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
- "Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\n\nTYBALT.\n[_Drawing._] I am for you."
- "ROMEO.\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nCome, sir, your passado.\n\n [_They fight._]"
- "ROMEO.\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,"
- "Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets."
- "Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\n\n [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]"
- "MERCUTIO.\nI am hurt.\nA plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.\nIs he gone, and hath nothing?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhat, art thou hurt?"
- "MERCUTIO.\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough."
- "Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\n\n [_Exit Page._]"
- "ROMEO.\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much."
- "MERCUTIO.\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis"
- "enough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a"
- "grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both"
- "your houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to"
- "death. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of"
- "arithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\narm."
- "ROMEO.\nI thought all for the best."
- "MERCUTIO.\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses."
- "They have made worms’ meat of me.\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!"
- "[_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]"
- "ROMEO.\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt"
- "In my behalf; my reputation stain’d\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour"
- "Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,\nThy beauty hath made me effeminate"
- "And in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.\n\n Re-enter Benvolio."
- "BENVOLIO.\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,\nThat gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,"
- Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
- "ROMEO.\nThis day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;\nThis but begins the woe others must end."
- "Re-enter Tybalt.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again."
- "ROMEO.\nAgain in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\nAway to heaven respective lenity,"
- "And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!\nNow, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again"
- "That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul\nIs but a little way above our heads,"
- "Staying for thine to keep him company.\nEither thou or I, or both, must go with him."
- "TYBALT.\nThou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\nShalt with him hence."
- "ROMEO.\nThis shall determine that.\n\n [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]"
- "BENVOLIO.\nRomeo, away, be gone!\nThe citizens are up, and Tybalt slain."
- "Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death\nIf thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!"
- "ROMEO.\nO, I am fortune’s fool!\n\nBENVOLIO.\nWhy dost thou stay?\n\n [_Exit Romeo._]\n\n Enter Citizens."
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nWhich way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?\nTybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThere lies that Tybalt."
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nUp, sir, go with me.\nI charge thee in the Prince’s name obey."
- "Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others."
- "PRINCE.\nWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nO noble Prince, I can discover all\nThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl."
- "There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\nThat slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nTybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!\nO Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d"
- "Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\nFor blood of ours shed blood of Montague."
- "O cousin, cousin.\n\nPRINCE.\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;"
- "Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal"
- "Your high displeasure. All this uttered\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d"
- "Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts"
- "With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,"
- "And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\nCold death aside, and with the other sends"
- "It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,"
- "‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,"
- "His agile arm beats down their fatal points,\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm"
- "An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled."
- "But by and by comes back to Romeo,\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,"
- "And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;"
- "And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true."
- "Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life."
- "I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live."
- "PRINCE.\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?"
- "MONTAGUE.\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;"
- "His fault concludes but what the law should end,\nThe life of Tybalt."
- "PRINCE.\nAnd for that offence\nImmediately we do exile him hence."
- "I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding."
- "But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine."
- "I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses."
- "Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last."
- "Bear hence this body, and attend our will.\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Juliet."
- "JULIET.\nGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,\nTowards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner"
- "As Phaeton would whip you to the west\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately."
- "Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\nThat runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo"
- "Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites"
- "By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,"
- "Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match,"
- "Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\nHood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,"
- "With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,\nThink true love acted simple modesty."
- "Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night"
- "Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.\nCome gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,"
- "Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,"
- "And he will make the face of heaven so fine\nThat all the world will be in love with night,"
- "And pay no worship to the garish sun.\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love,"
- "But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,\nNot yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day"
- "As is the night before some festival\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes"
- "And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,\nAnd she brings news, and every tongue that speaks"
- "But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.\n\n Enter Nurse, with cords."
- "Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?\nThe cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?"
- "NURSE.\nAy, ay, the cords.\n\n [_Throws them down._]"
- "JULIET.\nAy me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?"
- "NURSE.\nAh, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!\nWe are undone, lady, we are undone."
- "Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.\n\nJULIET.\nCan heaven be so envious?"
- "NURSE.\nRomeo can,\nThough heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.\nWho ever would have thought it? Romeo!"
- "JULIET.\nWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?"
- "This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.\nHath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,"
- "And that bare vowel I shall poison more\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice."
- "I am not I if there be such an I;\nOr those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay."
- "If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.\nBrief sounds determine of my weal or woe."
- "NURSE.\nI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\nGod save the mark!—here on his manly breast."
- "A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,"
- All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
- "JULIET.\nO, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.\nTo prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty."
- "Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier."
- "NURSE.\nO Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.\nO courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!"
- That ever I should live to see thee dead.
- "JULIET.\nWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?\nIs Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?"
- "My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?\nThen dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,"
- "For who is living, if those two are gone?"
- "NURSE.\nTybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,\nRomeo that kill’d him, he is banished."
- "JULIET.\nO God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?\n\nNURSE.\nIt did, it did; alas the day, it did."
- "JULIET.\nO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!\nDid ever dragon keep so fair a cave?"
- "Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,\nDove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!"
- "Despised substance of divinest show!\nJust opposite to what thou justly seem’st,"
- "A damned saint, an honourable villain!\nO nature, what hadst thou to do in hell"
- "When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\nIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?"
- "Was ever book containing such vile matter\nSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell"
- In such a gorgeous palace.
- "NURSE.\nThere’s no trust,\nNo faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,"
- "All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.\nAh, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae."
- "These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.\nShame come to Romeo."
- "JULIET.\nBlister’d be thy tongue\nFor such a wish! He was not born to shame."
- "Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;\nFor ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d"
- "Sole monarch of the universal earth.\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!"
- "NURSE.\nWill you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?"
- "JULIET.\nShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?"
- "Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,\nWhen I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?"
- "But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\nThat villain cousin would have kill’d my husband."
- "Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,"
- "Which you mistaking offer up to joy.\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,"
- "And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.\nAll this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?"
- "Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,\nThat murder’d me. I would forget it fain,"
- "But O, it presses to my memory\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds."
- "Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.\nThat ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’"
- "Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there."
- "Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,\nAnd needly will be rank’d with other griefs,"
- "Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,\nThy father or thy mother, nay or both,"
- "Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?\nBut with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,"
- "‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,"
- "All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,"
- "In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.\nWhere is my father and my mother, Nurse?"
- "NURSE.\nWeeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.\nWill you go to them? I will bring you thither."
- "JULIET.\nWash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,"
- "When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.\nTake up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,"
- "Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.\nHe made you for a highway to my bed,"
- "But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\nCome cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,"
- "And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead."
- "NURSE.\nHie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo\nTo comfort you. I wot well where he is."
- "Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.\nI’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell."
- "JULIET.\nO find him, give this ring to my true knight,\nAnd bid him come to take his last farewell."
- "[_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man."
- "Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts\nAnd thou art wedded to calamity.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "ROMEO.\nFather, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,"
- That I yet know not?
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nToo familiar\nIs my dear son with such sour company."
- "I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.\n\nROMEO.\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nA gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,\nNot body’s death, but body’s banishment."
- "ROMEO.\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,"
- Much more than death. Do not say banishment.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide."
- "ROMEO.\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself."
- "Hence banished is banish’d from the world,\nAnd world’s exile is death. Then banished"
- "Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\nThou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,"
- And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!"
- "Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\nTaking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,"
- "And turn’d that black word death to banishment.\nThis is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not."
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,"
- "And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,"
- "But Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives"
- "In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,"
- "And steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty"
- "Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished."
- "This may flies do, when I from this must fly.\nThey are free men but I am banished."
- "And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,"
- "No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?"
- "O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\nHowlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,"
- "Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,"
- "To mangle me with that word banished?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,"
- "ROMEO.\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,"
- "To comfort thee, though thou art banished."
- "ROMEO.\nYet banished? Hang up philosophy.\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,"
- "Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,\nIt helps not, it prevails not, talk no more."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, then I see that mad men have no ears."
- "ROMEO.\nHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate."
- "ROMEO.\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,"
- "An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\nDoting like me, and like me banished,"
- "Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\nAnd fall upon the ground as I do now,"
- "Taking the measure of an unmade grave.\n\n [_Knocking within._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nArise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself."
- "ROMEO.\nNot I, unless the breath of heartsick groans\nMist-like infold me from the search of eyes."
- "[_Knocking._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,"
- "Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.\n\n [_Knocking._]"
- "Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,\nWhat simpleness is this.—I come, I come.\n\n [_Knocking._]"
- "Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?"
- "NURSE.\n[_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\nI come from Lady Juliet."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWelcome then.\n\n Enter Nurse."
- "NURSE.\nO holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,\nWhere is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThere on the ground, with his own tears made drunk."
- "NURSE.\nO, he is even in my mistress’ case.\nJust in her case! O woeful sympathy!"
- "Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,\nBlubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering."
- "Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.\nFor Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand."
- "Why should you fall into so deep an O?\n\nROMEO.\nNurse."
- "NURSE.\nAh sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all."
- "ROMEO.\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\nDoth not she think me an old murderer,"
- "Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy\nWith blood remov’d but little from her own?"
- "Where is she? And how doth she? And what says\nMy conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?"
- "NURSE.\nO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,"
- "And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again."
- "ROMEO.\nAs if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,"
- "Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand\nMurder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,"
- "In what vile part of this anatomy\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\nThe hateful mansion."
- "[_Drawing his sword._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold thy desperate hand.\nArt thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art."
- "Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast."
- "Unseemly woman in a seeming man,\nAnd ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!"
- "Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,\nI thought thy disposition better temper’d."
- "Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\nAnd slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,"
- "By doing damned hate upon thyself?\nWhy rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?"
- "Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet"
- In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
- "Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\nWhich, like a usurer, abound’st in all,"
- "And usest none in that true use indeed\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit."
- "Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,\nDigressing from the valour of a man;"
- "Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\nKilling that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;"
- "Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,"
- "Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,"
- "And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.\nWhat, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,"
- "For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,"
- "But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.\nThe law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,"
- "And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.\nA pack of blessings light upon thy back;"
- "Happiness courts thee in her best array;\nBut like a misshaped and sullen wench,"
- "Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable."
- "Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,\nAscend her chamber, hence and comfort her."
- "But look thou stay not till the watch be set,\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua;"
- "Where thou shalt live till we can find a time\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,"
- "Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy"
- "Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.\nGo before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,"
- "And bid her hasten all the house to bed,\nWhich heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\nRomeo is coming."
- "NURSE.\nO Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night\nTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!"
- "My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.\n\nROMEO.\nDo so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide."
- "NURSE.\nHere sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.\nHie you, make haste, for it grows very late."
- "[_Exit._]\n\nROMEO.\nHow well my comfort is reviv’d by this."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGo hence, good night, and here stands all your state:"
- "Either be gone before the watch be set,\nOr by the break of day disguis’d from hence."
- "Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,\nAnd he shall signify from time to time"
- "Every good hap to you that chances here.\nGive me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night."
- "ROMEO.\nBut that a joy past joy calls out on me,\nIt were a grief so brief to part with thee."
- "Farewell.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Room in Capulet’s House."
- "Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris."
- "CAPULET.\nThings have fallen out, sir, so unluckily\nThat we have had no time to move our daughter."
- "Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\nAnd so did I. Well, we were born to die."
- "’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.\nI promise you, but for your company,"
- I would have been abed an hour ago.
- "PARIS.\nThese times of woe afford no tune to woo.\nMadam, good night. Commend me to your daughter."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nI will, and know her mind early tomorrow;\nTonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness."
- "CAPULET.\nSir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\nOf my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d"
- "In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\nWife, go you to her ere you go to bed,"
- "Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,\nAnd bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,"
- "But, soft, what day is this?\n\nPARIS.\nMonday, my lord."
- "CAPULET.\nMonday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,\nA Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,"
- "She shall be married to this noble earl.\nWill you be ready? Do you like this haste?"
- "We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,\nFor, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,"
- "It may be thought we held him carelessly,\nBeing our kinsman, if we revel much."
- "Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,\nAnd there an end. But what say you to Thursday?"
- "PARIS.\nMy lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow."
- "CAPULET.\nWell, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\nGo you to Juliet ere you go to bed,"
- "Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\nFarewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!"
- "Afore me, it is so very very late that we\nMay call it early by and by. Good night.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "SCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden.\n\n Enter Romeo and Juliet."
- "JULIET.\nWilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,"
- "That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;\nNightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree."
- "Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
- "ROMEO.\nIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,\nNo nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks"
- "Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.\nNight’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day"
- "Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die."
- "JULIET.\nYond light is not daylight, I know it, I.\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhales"
- "To be to thee this night a torchbearer\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua."
- "Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone."
- "ROMEO.\nLet me be ta’en, let me be put to death,\nI am content, so thou wilt have it so."
- "I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,\n’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow."
- "Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\nThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads."
- "I have more care to stay than will to go.\nCome, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so."
- "How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day."
- "JULIET.\nIt is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,"
- "Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\nSome say the lark makes sweet division;"
- "This doth not so, for she divideth us.\nSome say the lark and loathed toad change eyes."
- "O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,"
- "Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.\nO now be gone, more light and light it grows."
- "ROMEO.\nMore light and light, more dark and dark our woes.\n\n Enter Nurse.\n\nNURSE.\nMadam."
- "JULIET.\nNurse?"
- "NURSE.\nYour lady mother is coming to your chamber.\nThe day is broke, be wary, look about."
- "[_Exit._]\n\nJULIET.\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out."
- "ROMEO.\nFarewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.\n\n [_Descends._]"
- "JULIET.\nArt thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,"
- "I must hear from thee every day in the hour,\nFor in a minute there are many days."
- "O, by this count I shall be much in years\nEre I again behold my Romeo."
- "ROMEO.\nFarewell!\nI will omit no opportunity\nThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee."
- "JULIET.\nO thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?"
- "ROMEO.\nI doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve\nFor sweet discourses in our time to come."
- "JULIET.\nO God! I have an ill-divining soul!\nMethinks I see thee, now thou art so low,"
- "As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\nEither my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale."
- "ROMEO.\nAnd trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\nDry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu."
- "[_Exit below._]"
- "JULIET.\nO Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,\nIf thou art fickle, what dost thou with him"
- "That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;\nFor then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long"
- "But send him back.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\n[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?"
- "JULIET.\nWho is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?\nIs she not down so late, or up so early?"
- "What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?\n\n Enter Lady Capulet."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhy, how now, Juliet?\n\nJULIET.\nMadam, I am not well."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nEvermore weeping for your cousin’s death?"
- "What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?"
- "And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live."
- "Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,\nBut much of grief shows still some want of wit."
- "JULIET.\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\nWhich you weep for."
- "JULIET.\nFeeling so the loss,\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death"
- "As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.\n\nJULIET.\nWhat villain, madam?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThat same villain Romeo."
- "JULIET.\nVillain and he be many miles asunder.\nGod pardon him. I do, with all my heart."
- And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThat is because the traitor murderer lives."
- "JULIET.\nAy madam, from the reach of these my hands.\nWould none but I might venge my cousin’s death."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not."
- "Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,\nWhere that same banish’d runagate doth live,"
- "Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram\nThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company:"
- And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
- "JULIET.\nIndeed I never shall be satisfied\nWith Romeo till I behold him—dead—"
- "Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.\nMadam, if you could find out but a man"
- "To bear a poison, I would temper it,\nThat Romeo should upon receipt thereof,"
- "Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\nTo hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,"
- "To wreak the love I bore my cousin\nUpon his body that hath slaughter’d him."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nFind thou the means, and I’ll find such a man."
- "But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl."
- "JULIET.\nAnd joy comes well in such a needy time.\nWhat are they, I beseech your ladyship?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\nOne who to put thee from thy heaviness,"
- "Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,\nThat thou expects not, nor I look’d not for."
- "JULIET.\nMadam, in happy time, what day is that?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn\nThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,"
- "The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,\nShall happily make thee there a joyful bride."
- "JULIET.\nNow by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride."
- "I wonder at this haste, that I must wed\nEre he that should be husband comes to woo."
- "I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\nI will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear"
- "It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHere comes your father, tell him so yourself,"
- "And see how he will take it at your hands.\n\n Enter Capulet and Nurse."
- "CAPULET.\nWhen the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;\nBut for the sunset of my brother’s son"
- "It rains downright.\nHow now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?"
- "Evermore showering? In one little body\nThou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind."
- "For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\nDo ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,"
- "Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,\nWho raging with thy tears and they with them,"
- "Without a sudden calm will overset\nThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?"
- Have you deliver’d to her our decree?
- "LADY CAPULET.\nAy, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks."
- I would the fool were married to her grave.
- "CAPULET.\nSoft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife."
- "How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\nIs she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,"
- "Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?"
- "JULIET.\nNot proud you have, but thankful that you have.\nProud can I never be of what I hate;"
- But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
- "CAPULET.\nHow now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?"
- "Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;\nAnd yet not proud. Mistress minion you,"
- "Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\nBut fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next"
- "To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither."
- "Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!\nYou tallow-face!"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nFie, fie! What, are you mad?"
- "JULIET.\nGood father, I beseech you on my knees,\nHear me with patience but to speak a word."
- "CAPULET.\nHang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!"
- "I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,\nOr never after look me in the face."
- "Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.\nMy fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest"
- "That God had lent us but this only child;\nBut now I see this one is one too much,"
- "And that we have a curse in having her.\nOut on her, hilding."
- "NURSE.\nGod in heaven bless her.\nYou are to blame, my lord, to rate her so."
- "CAPULET.\nAnd why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,\nGood prudence; smatter with your gossips, go."
- "NURSE.\nI speak no treason.\n\nCAPULET.\nO God ye good-en!\n\nNURSE.\nMay not one speak?"
- "CAPULET.\nPeace, you mumbling fool!\nUtter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,\nFor here we need it not."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nYou are too hot."
- "CAPULET.\nGod’s bread, it makes me mad!\nDay, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,"
- "Alone, in company, still my care hath been\nTo have her match’d, and having now provided"
- "A gentleman of noble parentage,\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,"
- "Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,\nProportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,"
- "And then to have a wretched puling fool,\nA whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,"
- "To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,\nI am too young, I pray you pardon me.’"
- "But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me."
- "Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise."
- "And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;\nAnd you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,"
- "For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,\nNor what is mine shall never do thee good."
- "Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nIs there no pity sitting in the clouds,\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?"
- "O sweet my mother, cast me not away,\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week,"
- "Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nTalk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.\nDo as thou wilt, for I have done with thee."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nO God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?\nMy husband is on earth, my faith in heaven."
- "How shall that faith return again to earth,\nUnless that husband send it me from heaven"
- "By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.\nAlack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems"
- "Upon so soft a subject as myself.\nWhat say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?"
- "Some comfort, Nurse."
- "NURSE.\nFaith, here it is.\nRomeo is banished; and all the world to nothing"
- "That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.\nOr if he do, it needs must be by stealth."
- "Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,\nI think it best you married with the County."
- "O, he’s a lovely gentleman.\nRomeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,"
- "Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,"
- "I think you are happy in this second match,\nFor it excels your first: or if it did not,"
- "Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,\nAs living here and you no use of him."
- "JULIET.\nSpeakest thou from thy heart?\n\nNURSE.\nAnd from my soul too,\nOr else beshrew them both."
- "JULIET.\nAmen.\n\nNURSE.\nWhat?"
- "JULIET.\nWell, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\nGo in, and tell my lady I am gone,"
- "Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,\nTo make confession and to be absolv’d."
- "NURSE.\nMarry, I will; and this is wisely done.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nAncient damnation! O most wicked fiend!\nIs it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,"
- "Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue\nWhich she hath prais’d him with above compare"
- "So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.\nThou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain."
- "I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.\nIf all else fail, myself have power to die.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "ACT IV\n\nSCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nOn Thursday, sir? The time is very short."
- "PARIS.\nMy father Capulet will have it so;\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nYou say you do not know the lady’s mind.\nUneven is the course; I like it not."
- "PARIS.\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk’d of love;"
- "For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous"
- "That she do give her sorrow so much sway;\nAnd in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,"
- "To stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,"
- "May be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\n[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—"
- "Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\n\n Enter Juliet."
- "PARIS.\nHappily met, my lady and my wife!\n\nJULIET.\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife."
- "PARIS.\nThat may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.\n\nJULIET.\nWhat must be shall be."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThat’s a certain text.\n\nPARIS.\nCome you to make confession to this father?"
- "JULIET.\nTo answer that, I should confess to you.\n\nPARIS.\nDo not deny to him that you love me."
- "JULIET.\nI will confess to you that I love him.\n\nPARIS.\nSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me."
- "JULIET.\nIf I do so, it will be of more price,\nBeing spoke behind your back than to your face."
- "PARIS.\nPoor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears."
- "JULIET.\nThe tears have got small victory by that;\nFor it was bad enough before their spite."
- "PARIS.\nThou wrong’st it more than tears with that report."
- "JULIET.\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face."
- "PARIS.\nThy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it."
- "JULIET.\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own.\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,"
- Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—"
- "My lord, we must entreat the time alone."
- "PARIS.\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!—\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,"
- "Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "JULIET.\nO shut the door, and when thou hast done so,"
- "Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief;\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits."
- "I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\nOn Thursday next be married to this County."
- "JULIET.\nTell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it."
- "If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise,"
- "And with this knife I’ll help it presently.\nGod join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;"
- "And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,\nShall be the label to another deed,"
- "Or my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both."
- "Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,\nGive me some present counsel, or behold"
- "’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that"
- "Which the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honour bring."
- "Be not so long to speak. I long to die,\nIf what thou speak’st speak not of remedy."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution"
- "As that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris"
- "Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake"
- "A thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop’st with death himself to scape from it."
- "And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy."
- "JULIET.\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,"
- "Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;"
- "Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,\nO’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,"
- "With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave,"
- "And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,"
- "And I will do it without fear or doubt,\nTo live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold then. Go home, be merry, give consent\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;"
- "Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,\nLet not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber."
- "Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off,"
- "When presently through all thy veins shall run\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse"
- "Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.\nNo warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,"
- "The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\nTo paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,"
- "Like death when he shuts up the day of life.\nEach part depriv’d of supple government,"
- "Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.\nAnd in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death"
- "Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep."
- "Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead."
- "Then as the manner of our country is,\nIn thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,"
- "Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie."
- "In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift,"
- "And hither shall he come, and he and I\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night"
- "Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,"
- "If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\nAbate thy valour in the acting it."
- "JULIET.\nGive me, give me! O tell not me of fear!"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous"
- "In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed\nTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord."
- "JULIET.\nLove give me strength, and strength shall help afford.\nFarewell, dear father.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "SCENE II. Hall in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants."
- "CAPULET.\nSo many guests invite as here are writ.\n\n [_Exit first Servant._]"
- "Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks."
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nYou shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can lick their\nfingers."
- "CAPULET.\nHow canst thou try them so?"
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nMarry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;"
- "therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.\n\nCAPULET.\nGo, begone."
- "[_Exit second Servant._]"
- "We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.\nWhat, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?"
- "NURSE.\nAy, forsooth."
- "CAPULET.\nWell, he may chance to do some good on her.\nA peevish self-will’d harlotry it is."
- "Enter Juliet.\n\nNURSE.\nSee where she comes from shrift with merry look."
- "CAPULET.\nHow now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?"
- "JULIET.\nWhere I have learnt me to repent the sin\nOf disobedient opposition"
- "To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d\nBy holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,"
- "To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.\nHenceforward I am ever rul’d by you."
- "CAPULET.\nSend for the County, go tell him of this.\nI’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning."
- "JULIET.\nI met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,\nAnd gave him what becomed love I might,"
- Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.
- "CAPULET.\nWhy, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.\nThis is as’t should be. Let me see the County."
- "Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.\nNow afore God, this reverend holy Friar,"
- All our whole city is much bound to him.
- "JULIET.\nNurse, will you go with me into my closet,\nTo help me sort such needful ornaments"
- "As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nNo, not till Thursday. There is time enough."
- "CAPULET.\nGo, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.\n\n [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWe shall be short in our provision,\n’Tis now near night."
- "CAPULET.\nTush, I will stir about,\nAnd all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife."
- "Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.\nI’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone."
- "I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!—\nThey are all forth: well, I will walk myself"
- "To County Paris, to prepare him up\nAgainst tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light"
- "Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Juliet’s Chamber."
- Enter Juliet and Nurse.
- "JULIET.\nAy, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,\nI pray thee leave me to myself tonight;"
- "For I have need of many orisons\nTo move the heavens to smile upon my state,"
- "Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.\n\n Enter Lady Capulet."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhat, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?"
- "JULIET.\nNo, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries\nAs are behoveful for our state tomorrow."
- "So please you, let me now be left alone,\nAnd let the nurse this night sit up with you,"
- "For I am sure you have your hands full all\nIn this so sudden business."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nGood night.\nGet thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need."
- "[_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]"
- "JULIET.\nFarewell. God knows when we shall meet again."
- "I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins\nThat almost freezes up the heat of life."
- "I’ll call them back again to comfort me.\nNurse!—What should she do here?"
- "My dismal scene I needs must act alone.\nCome, vial.\nWhat if this mixture do not work at all?"
- "Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?\nNo, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there."
- "[_Laying down her dagger._]"
- "What if it be a poison, which the Friar\nSubtly hath minister’d to have me dead,"
- "Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,\nBecause he married me before to Romeo?"
- "I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,\nFor he hath still been tried a holy man."
- "How if, when I am laid into the tomb,\nI wake before the time that Romeo"
- "Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!\nShall I not then be stifled in the vault,"
- "To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\nAnd there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?"
- "Or, if I live, is it not very like,\nThe horrible conceit of death and night,"
- "Together with the terror of the place,\nAs in a vault, an ancient receptacle,"
- "Where for this many hundred years the bones\nOf all my buried ancestors are pack’d,"
- "Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\nLies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,"
- "At some hours in the night spirits resort—\nAlack, alack, is it not like that I,"
- "So early waking, what with loathsome smells,\nAnd shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,"
- "That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.\nO, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,"
- "Environed with all these hideous fears,\nAnd madly play with my forefathers’ joints?"
- "And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?\nAnd, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,"
- "As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?\nO look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost"
- "Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body\nUpon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!"
- "Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.\n\n [_Throws herself on the bed._]"
- "SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse."
- "NURSE.\nThey call for dates and quinces in the pastry.\n\n Enter Capulet."
- "CAPULET.\nCome, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow’d,"
- "The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.\nLook to the bak’d meats, good Angelica;"
- Spare not for cost.
- "NURSE.\nGo, you cot-quean, go,\nGet you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow"
- For this night’s watching.
- "CAPULET.\nNo, not a whit. What! I have watch’d ere now"
- "All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick."
- "LADY CAPULET.\nAy, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;"
- "But I will watch you from such watching now.\n\n [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]"
- "CAPULET.\nA jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!\n\n Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets."
- "Now, fellow, what’s there?\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nThings for the cook, sir; but I know not what."
- "CAPULET.\nMake haste, make haste.\n\n [_Exit First Servant._]"
- "—Sirrah, fetch drier logs.\nCall Peter, he will show thee where they are."
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nI have a head, sir, that will find out logs\nAnd never trouble Peter for the matter."
- "[_Exit._]"
- "CAPULET.\nMass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha.\nThou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day."
- "The County will be here with music straight,\nFor so he said he would. I hear him near."
- "[_Play music._]\n\nNurse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nurse, I say!\n\n Re-enter Nurse."
- "Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up.\nI’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,"
- "Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already.\nMake haste I say.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "SCENE V. Juliet’s Chamber; Juliet on the bed.\n\n Enter Nurse."
- "NURSE.\nMistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she."
- "Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed!\nWhy, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!"
- "What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now.\nSleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,"
- "The County Paris hath set up his rest\nThat you shall rest but little. God forgive me!"
- "Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep!\nI needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!"
- "Ay, let the County take you in your bed,\nHe’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?"
- "What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?\nI must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!"
- "Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!\nO, well-a-day that ever I was born."
- "Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady!\n\n Enter Lady Capulet.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWhat noise is here?"
- "NURSE.\nO lamentable day!\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWhat is the matter?\n\nNURSE.\nLook, look! O heavy day!"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO me, O me! My child, my only life.\nRevive, look up, or I will die with thee."
- "Help, help! Call help.\n\n Enter Capulet.\n\nCAPULET.\nFor shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come."
- "NURSE.\nShe’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day!"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nAlack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!"
- "CAPULET.\nHa! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,\nHer blood is settled and her joints are stiff."
- "Life and these lips have long been separated.\nDeath lies on her like an untimely frost"
- "Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.\n\nNURSE.\nO lamentable day!\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nO woful time!"
- "CAPULET.\nDeath, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,"
- "Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nCome, is the bride ready to go to church?"
- "CAPULET.\nReady to go, but never to return.\nO son, the night before thy wedding day"
- "Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,\nFlower as she was, deflowered by him."
- "Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;\nMy daughter he hath wedded. I will die."
- "And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s."
- "PARIS.\nHave I thought long to see this morning’s face,\nAnd doth it give me such a sight as this?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nAccurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.\nMost miserable hour that e’er time saw"
- "In lasting labour of his pilgrimage.\nBut one, poor one, one poor and loving child,"
- "But one thing to rejoice and solace in,\nAnd cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight."
- "NURSE.\nO woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.\nMost lamentable day, most woeful day"
- "That ever, ever, I did yet behold!\nO day, O day, O day, O hateful day."
- "Never was seen so black a day as this.\nO woeful day, O woeful day."
- "PARIS.\nBeguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.\nMost detestable death, by thee beguil’d,"
- "By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.\nO love! O life! Not life, but love in death!"
- "CAPULET.\nDespis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.\nUncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now"
- "To murder, murder our solemnity?\nO child! O child! My soul, and not my child,"
- "Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,\nAnd with my child my joys are buried."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nPeace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not"
- "In these confusions. Heaven and yourself\nHad part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,"
- "And all the better is it for the maid.\nYour part in her you could not keep from death,"
- "But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.\nThe most you sought was her promotion,"
- "For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,\nAnd weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d"
- "Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?\nO, in this love, you love your child so ill"
- "That you run mad, seeing that she is well.\nShe’s not well married that lives married long,"
- "But she’s best married that dies married young.\nDry up your tears, and stick your rosemary"
- "On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,\nAnd in her best array bear her to church;"
- "For though fond nature bids us all lament,\nYet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment."
- "CAPULET.\nAll things that we ordained festival\nTurn from their office to black funeral:"
- "Our instruments to melancholy bells,\nOur wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;"
- "Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;\nOur bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,"
- And all things change them to the contrary.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,\nAnd go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare"
- "To follow this fair corse unto her grave.\nThe heavens do lower upon you for some ill;"
- "Move them no more by crossing their high will.\n\n [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]"
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nFaith, we may put up our pipes and be gone."
- "NURSE.\nHonest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,\nFor well you know this is a pitiful case."
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nAy, by my troth, the case may be amended.\n\n [_Exit Nurse._]\n\n Enter Peter."
- "PETER.\nMusicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘Heart’s ease’, O, and you"
- "will have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\nWhy ‘Heart’s ease’?"

- "me some merry dump to comfort me.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\nNot a dump we, ’tis no time to play now."
- "PETER.\nYou will not then?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\nNo.\n\nPETER.\nI will then give it you soundly."
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nWhat will you give us?"
- "PETER.\nNo money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel."
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nThen will I give you the serving-creature."
- "PETER.\nThen will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will"
- "carry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?"
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nAnd you re us and fa us, you note us."
- "SECOND MUSICIAN.\nPray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit."
- "PETER.\nThen have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and"
- "put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.\n    ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,"
- "And doleful dumps the mind oppress,\n    Then music with her silver sound’—"
- "Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,\nSimon Catling?"
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nMarry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound."
- "PETER.\nPrates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?"
- "SECOND MUSICIAN.\nI say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver."
- "PETER.\nPrates too! What say you, James Soundpost?\n\nTHIRD MUSICIAN.\nFaith, I know not what to say."
- "PETER.\nO, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is"
- "‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for\nsounding."
- "‘Then music with her silver sound\n      With speedy help doth lend redress.’\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "FIRST MUSICIAN.\nWhat a pestilent knave is this same!"
- "SECOND MUSICIAN.\nHang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay\ndinner."

- "ACT V\n\nSCENE I. Mantua. A Street.\n\n Enter Romeo."
- "ROMEO.\nIf I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,\nMy dreams presage some joyful news at hand."
- "My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;\nAnd all this day an unaccustom’d spirit"
- "Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.\nI dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—"
- "Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—\nAnd breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,"
- "That I reviv’d, and was an emperor.\nAh me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,"
- "When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.\n\n Enter Balthasar."
- "News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?\nDost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?"
- "How doth my lady? Is my father well?\nHow fares my Juliet? That I ask again;"
- For nothing can be ill if she be well.
- "BALTHASAR.\nThen she is well, and nothing can be ill.\nHer body sleeps in Capel’s monument,"
- "And her immortal part with angels lives.\nI saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,"
- "And presently took post to tell it you.\nO pardon me for bringing these ill news,"
- "Since you did leave it for my office, sir."
- "ROMEO.\nIs it even so? Then I defy you, stars!\nThou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,"
- And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
- "BALTHASAR.\nI do beseech you sir, have patience.\nYour looks are pale and wild, and do import"
- Some misadventure.
- "ROMEO.\nTush, thou art deceiv’d.\nLeave me, and do the thing I bid thee do."
- "Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?\n\nBALTHASAR.\nNo, my good lord."
- "ROMEO.\nNo matter. Get thee gone,\nAnd hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight."
- "[_Exit Balthasar._]"
- "Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.\nLet’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift"
- "To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.\nI do remember an apothecary,—"
- "And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted\nIn tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,"
- "Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;"
- "And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\nAn alligator stuff’d, and other skins"
- "Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,"
- "Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses"
- "Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,"
- "And if a man did need a poison now,\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,"
- "Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,"
- "And this same needy man must sell it me.\nAs I remember, this should be the house."
- "Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.\nWhat, ho! Apothecary!\n\n Enter Apothecary."
- "APOTHECARY.\nWho calls so loud?"
- "ROMEO.\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have"
- "A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins,"
- "That the life-weary taker may fall dead,\nAnd that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath"
- "As violently as hasty powder fir’d\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb."
- "APOTHECARY.\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law\nIs death to any he that utters them."
- "ROMEO.\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\nAnd fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,"
- "Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back."
- "The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;"
- "Then be not poor, but break it and take this.\n\nAPOTHECARY.\nMy poverty, but not my will consents."
- "ROMEO.\nI pay thy poverty, and not thy will."
- "APOTHECARY.\nPut this in any liquid thing you will\nAnd drink it off; and, if you had the strength"
- "Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight."
- "ROMEO.\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,\nDoing more murder in this loathsome world"
- "Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\nI sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none."
- "Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me"
- "To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Friar Lawrence’s Cell."
- "Enter Friar John.\n\nFRIAR JOHN.\nHoly Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThis same should be the voice of Friar John.\nWelcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?"
- "Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter."
- "FRIAR JOHN.\nGoing to find a barefoot brother out,\nOne of our order, to associate me,"
- "Here in this city visiting the sick,\nAnd finding him, the searchers of the town,"
- "Suspecting that we both were in a house\nWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,"
- "Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,\nSo that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWho bare my letter then to Romeo?"
- "FRIAR JOHN.\nI could not send it,—here it is again,—\nNor get a messenger to bring it thee,"
- So fearful were they of infection.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nUnhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\nThe letter was not nice, but full of charge,"
- "Of dear import, and the neglecting it\nMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence,"
- "Get me an iron crow and bring it straight\nUnto my cell."
- "FRIAR JOHN.\nBrother, I’ll go and bring it thee.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNow must I to the monument alone.\nWithin this three hours will fair Juliet wake."
- "She will beshrew me much that Romeo\nHath had no notice of these accidents;"
- "But I will write again to Mantua,\nAnd keep her at my cell till Romeo come."
- "Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.
- "Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch."
- "PARIS.\nGive me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.\nYet put it out, for I would not be seen."
- "Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,\nHolding thy ear close to the hollow ground;"
- "So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,\nBeing loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,"
- "But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,\nAs signal that thou hear’st something approach."
- "Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go."
- "PAGE.\n[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone\nHere in the churchyard; yet I will adventure."
- "[_Retires._]"
- "PARIS.\nSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.\nO woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,"
- "Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,\nOr wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans."
- "The obsequies that I for thee will keep,\nNightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep."
- "[_The Page whistles._]"
- "The boy gives warning something doth approach.\nWhat cursed foot wanders this way tonight,"
- "To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?\nWhat, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile."
- "[_Retires._]\n\n Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c."
- "ROMEO.\nGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\nHold, take this letter; early in the morning"
- "See thou deliver it to my lord and father.\nGive me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,"
- "Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof\nAnd do not interrupt me in my course."
- "Why I descend into this bed of death\nIs partly to behold my lady’s face,"
- "But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\nA precious ring, a ring that I must use"
- "In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry"
- "In what I further shall intend to do,\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,"
- "And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;"
- "More fierce and more inexorable far\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea."
- "BALTHASAR.\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you."
- "ROMEO.\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that."
- "Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow."
- "BALTHASAR.\nFor all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt."
- "[_Retires_]"
- "ROMEO.\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\nGorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,"
- "Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\n\n [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]"
- "And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food."
- "PARIS.\nThis is that banish’d haughty Montague\nThat murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,"
- "It is supposed, the fair creature died,—\nAnd here is come to do some villanous shame"
- "To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\n\n [_Advances._]"
- "Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.\nCan vengeance be pursu’d further than death?"
- "Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\nObey, and go with me, for thou must die."
- "ROMEO.\nI must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\nGood gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man."
- "Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,"
- "Put not another sin upon my head\nBy urging me to fury. O be gone."
- "By heaven I love thee better than myself;\nFor I come hither arm’d against myself."
- "Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,\nA madman’s mercy bid thee run away."
- "PARIS.\nI do defy thy conjuration,\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here."
- "ROMEO.\nWilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\n\n [_They fight._]"
- "PAGE.\nO lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- "PARIS.\nO, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,\nOpen the tomb, lay me with Juliet.\n\n [_Dies._]"
- "ROMEO.\nIn faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\nMercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!"
- "What said my man, when my betossed soul\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think"
- "He told me Paris should have married Juliet.\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?"
- "Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,"
- "One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.\nI’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave."
- "A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes"
- "This vault a feasting presence full of light.\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d."
- "[_Laying Paris in the monument._]"
- "How oft when men are at the point of death\nHave they been merry! Which their keepers call"
- "A lightning before death. O, how may I\nCall this a lightning? O my love, my wife,"
- "Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty."
- "Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,"
- "And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?"
- "O, what more favour can I do to thee\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain"
- "To sunder his that was thine enemy?\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,"
- "Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;"
- "And that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?"
- "For fear of that I still will stay with thee,\nAnd never from this palace of dim night"
- "Depart again. Here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here"
- "Will I set up my everlasting rest;\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars"
- "From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you"
- "The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death."
- "Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on"
- "The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\nHere’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!"
- "Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\n\n [_Dies._]"
- "Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a\n lantern, crow, and spade."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSaint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight"
- "Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?\nWho is it that consorts, so late, the dead?"
- "BALTHASAR.\nHere’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,"
- "What torch is yond that vainly lends his light\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,"
- It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
- "BALTHASAR.\nIt doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,\nOne that you love."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWho is it?\n\nBALTHASAR.\nRomeo.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHow long hath he been there?"
- "BALTHASAR.\nFull half an hour.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGo with me to the vault."
- "BALTHASAR.\nI dare not, sir;\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,"
- "And fearfully did menace me with death\nIf I did stay to look on his intents."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nStay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\nO, much I fear some ill unlucky thing."
- "BALTHASAR.\nAs I did sleep under this yew tree here,\nI dreamt my master and another fought,"
- And that my master slew him.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo! [_Advances._]\nAlack, alack, what blood is this which stains"
- "The stony entrance of this sepulchre?\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords"
- "To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?\n\n [_Enters the monument._]"
- "Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\nAnd steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour"
- "Is guilty of this lamentable chance?\nThe lady stirs.\n\n [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]"
- "JULIET.\nO comfortable Friar, where is my lord?\nI do remember well where I should be,"
- "And there I am. Where is my Romeo?\n\n [_Noise within._]"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest"
- "Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\nA greater power than we can contradict"
- "Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;"
- "And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns."
- "Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.\nCome, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay."
- "JULIET.\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.\n\n [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]"
- "What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?\nPoison, I see, hath been his timeless end."
- "O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop\nTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips."
- "Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,\nTo make me die with a restorative.\n\n [_Kisses him._]"
- "Thy lips are warm!\n\nFIRST WATCH.\n[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?"
- "JULIET.\nYea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.\n\n [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]"
- "This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die."
- "[_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]\n\n Enter Watch with the Page of Paris."
- "PAGE.\nThis is the place. There, where the torch doth burn."
- "FIRST WATCH.\nThe ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard."
- "Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.\n\n [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]"
- "Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,"
- "Who here hath lain this two days buried.\nGo tell the Prince; run to the Capulets."
- "Raise up the Montagues, some others search.\n\n [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]"
- "We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes"
- "We cannot without circumstance descry.\n\n Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar."
- "SECOND WATCH.\nHere’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard."
- "FIRST WATCH.\nHold him in safety till the Prince come hither."
- Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.
- "THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps."
- "We took this mattock and this spade from him\nAs he was coming from this churchyard side."
- "FIRST WATCH.\nA great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.\n\n Enter the Prince and Attendants."
- "PRINCE.\nWhat misadventure is so early up,\nThat calls our person from our morning’s rest?"
- "Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.\n\nCAPULET.\nWhat should it be that they so shriek abroad?"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO the people in the street cry Romeo,\nSome Juliet, and some Paris, and all run"
- "With open outcry toward our monument.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?"
- "FIRST WATCH.\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,\nAnd Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,"
- "Warm and new kill’d.\n\nPRINCE.\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes."
- "FIRST WATCH.\nHere is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,\nWith instruments upon them fit to open"
- These dead men’s tombs.
- "CAPULET.\nO heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!"
- "This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,"
- And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO me! This sight of death is as a bell\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre."
- Enter Montague and others.
- "PRINCE.\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up,\nTo see thy son and heir more early down."
- "MONTAGUE.\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\nGrief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath."
- "What further woe conspires against mine age?\n\nPRINCE.\nLook, and thou shalt see."
- "MONTAGUE.\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\nTo press before thy father to a grave?"
- "PRINCE.\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities,"
- "And know their spring, their head, their true descent,\nAnd then will I be general of your woes,"
- "And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience."
- Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place"
- "Doth make against me, of this direful murder.\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge"
- "Myself condemned and myself excus’d.\n\nPRINCE.\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this."
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale."
- "Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife."
- "I married them; and their stol’n marriage day\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death"
- "Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d."
- "You, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce"
- "To County Paris. Then comes she to me,\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means"
- "To rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself."
- "Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect"
- "As I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo"
- "That he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,"
- "Being the time the potion’s force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,"
- "Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone"
- "At the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,"
- "Meaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo."
- "But when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay"
- "The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth"
- "And bear this work of heaven with patience.\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;"
- "And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself."
- "All this I know; and to the marriage\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this"
- "Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,"
- Unto the rigour of severest law.
- "PRINCE.\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?"
- "BALTHASAR.\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua"
- "To this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,"
- "And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not, and left him there."
- "PRINCE.\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?"
- "Sirrah, what made your master in this place?"
- "PAGE.\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did."
- "Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,"
- And then I ran away to call the watch.
- "PRINCE.\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,"
- "Their course of love, the tidings of her death.\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison"
- "Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet."
- "Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,"
- "That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,"
- Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
- "CAPULET.\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more"
- Can I demand.
- "MONTAGUE.\nBut I can give thee more,\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,"
- "That whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set"
- As that of true and faithful Juliet.
- "CAPULET.\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity."
- "PRINCE.\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head."
- "Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,"
- "For never was a story of more woe\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"

- The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
