- "------------------------------------------------"
- "This page offers a brief overview of what it's"
- "like to use Markdown.\nThe [syntax page]"
- "[s]"
- "provides complete, detailed documentation for"
- "every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to"
- pick up simply by
- looking at a few examples of it in action.
- The examples on this page
- "are written in a before/after style, showing"
- example syntax and the
- "HTML output produced by Markdown.\n\nIt'"
- s also helpful to simply try Markdown out; the
- "[Dingus] [d]"
- is a
- web application that allows you type your own Markdown-
- "formatted text\nand translate it to XHTML."
- "**Note:** This document is itself written using Markdown"
- "; you\ncan ["
- "see the source for it by adding '.text'"
- "to the URL] [src]"

- "## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ##"
- A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of
- "text, separated"
- by one or more blank lines.
- (A blank line is any line that looks like
- a blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces
- or tabs is
- considered blank.)
- Normal paragraphs should not be indented with
- spaces or tabs.
- "Markdown offers two styles of headers: *Setext"
- "* and *atx*"
- ".\nSetext-style headers for `<h1>`"
- "and `<h2>`"
- "are created by\n\"underlining\""
- "with equal signs (`=`) and hyphens"
- "(`-`"
- "), respectively."
- "To create an atx-style header, you put"
- "1-6 hash marks (`#`"
- ") at the\nbeginning of the line --"
- the number of hashes equals the resulting
- HTML header level.
- "Blockquotes are indicated using email-style '`>`'"
- "angle brackets.\n\nMarkdown:"
- "A First Level Header\n    ===================="
- "A Second Level Header\n    ---------------------"
- Now is the time for all good men to come
- to
- the aid of their country. This is just a
- regular paragraph.
- The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
- "dog's back.\n\n    ### Header 3"
- "> This is a blockquote.\n    >"
- "> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote"
- ".\n    >"
- "> ## This is an H2 in a"
- "blockquote\n\n\nOutput:"
- "<h1>A First Level Header</h1>"
- "<h2>A Second Level Header</h2>"
- "<p>Now is the time for all good men"
- to come to
- the aid of their country. This is just a
- regular paragraph.</p>
- "<p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy"
- "dog's back.</p>"
- "<h3>Header 3</h3>"
- "<blockquote>"
- "<p>This is a blockquote.</p>"
- "<p>This is the second paragraph in the blockquote"
- ".</p>"
- "<h2>This is an H2 in a"
- "blockquote</h2>\n    </blockquote>\n\n\n\n###"
- "Phrase Emphasis ###"
- Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of
- "emphasis.\n\nMarkdown:"
- Some of these words *are emphasized*.
- Some of these words _are emphasized also_.
- Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
- "Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores"
- "instead__.\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>Some of these words <em>are"
- emphasized</em>.
- Some of these words <em>are emphasized also
- "</em>.</p>"
- "<p>Use two asterisks for <strong>"
- strong emphasis</strong>.
- "Or, if you prefer, <strong>use"
- "two underscores instead</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n## Lists"
- "##"
- Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks
- ", pluses, and hyphens (`*"
- "`,\n`+`, and `-`"
- ) as list markers. These three markers are
- "interchangable; this:"
- "*   Candy.\n    *   Gum."
- "*   Booze.\n\nthis:"
- "+   Candy.\n    +   Gum."
- "+   Booze.\n\nand this:"
- "-   Candy.\n    -   Gum."
- "-   Booze."
- "all produce the same output:"
- "<ul>\n    <li>Candy.</li>"
- "<li>Gum.</li>"
- "<li>Booze.</li>"
- "</ul>"
- "Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers,"
- "followed by periods, as\nlist markers:"
- "1.  Red\n    2."
- "Green\n    3.  Blue"
- "Output:"
- "<ol>"
- "<li>Red</li>"
- "<li>Green</li>"
- "<li>Blue</li>\n    </ol>"
- "If you put blank lines between items, you'll"
- "get `<p>`"
- tags for the
- list item text.
- You can create multi-paragraph list items by
- indenting
- the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab
- ":"
- "*   A list item."
- With multiple paragraphs.
- "*   Another item in the list.\n\nOutput:"
- "<ul>"
- "<li><p>A list item.</p>"
- "<p>With multiple paragraphs.</p></li>"
- "<li><p>Another item in the list.</"
- "p></li>\n    </ul>\n\n\n\n### Links"
- "###\n\nMarkdown supports two styles for creating links:"
- "*inline* and\n*reference*"
- "."
- "With both styles, you use square brackets to"
- delimit the
- text you want to turn into a link.
- Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text
- ".\nFor example:"
- "This is an [example link](http://"
- "example.com/).\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>This is an <a href=\"http://"
- "example.com/\">"
- example link</a>.</p>
- "Optionally, you may include a title attribute in"
- "the parentheses:"
- "This is an [example link](http://"
- "example.com/ \"With a Title\").\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>This is an <a href=\"http://"
- "example.com/\" title=\"With a Title\">"
- example link</a>.</p>
- Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links
- "by names, which"
- "you define elsewhere in your document:"
- "I get 10 times more traffic from [Google"
- "][1] than from"
- "[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3"
- "]."
- "[1]: http://google.com/        \""
- "Google\""
- "[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/"
- "\"Yahoo Search\""
- "[3]: http://search.msn.com/"
- "\"MSN Search\"\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>I get 10 times more traffic from <"
- "a href=\"http://google.com/\""
- "title=\"Google\">Google</a> than from"
- "<a href=\"http://search.yahoo.com/\""
- "title=\"Yahoo Search\">Yahoo</a> or"
- "<a href=\"http://search.msn.com/\""
- "title=\"MSN Search\">MSN</a>.</p"
- ">"
- The title attribute is optional.
- "Link names may contain letters,"
- "numbers and spaces, but are *not* case"
- "sensitive:"
- I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
- "[The New York Times][NY Times]."
- "[ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com"
- "/\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>I start my morning with a cup of coffee"
- and
- "<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">"
- "The New York Times</a>.</p>\n\n\n###"
- "Images ###"
- Image syntax is very much like link syntax.
- "Inline (titles are optional):"
- "!["
- "alt text](/path/to/img.jpg \"Title"
- "\")\n\nReference-style:"
- "![alt text][id]"
- "[id]: /path/to/img.jpg \"Title\""
- "Both of the above examples produce the same output:"
- "<img src=\"/path/to/img.jpg\" alt=\""
- "alt text\" title=\"Title\" />\n\n\n\n###"
- "Code ###"
- "In a regular paragraph, you can create code span"
- by wrapping text in
- backtick quotes. Any ampersands (
- "`&`) and angle brackets (`<` or"
- "`>`) will automatically be translated into HTML entities"
- ". This makes"
- it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example
- "code:"
- "I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags"
- "."
- "I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `"
- "&mdash;`"
- "instead of decimal-encoded entities like `&#8212"
- ";`.\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>I strongly recommend against using any"
- "<code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>"
- tags.</p>
- "<p>I wish SmartyPants used named entities like"
- "<code>&amp;mdash;</code>"
- instead of decimal-encoded
- "entities like <code>&amp;#8212"
- ;</code>.</p>
- To specify an entire block of pre-formatted code
- ", indent every line of"
- the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab
- ". Just like with code spans, `&`,"
- "`<`,\nand `>`"
- "characters will be escaped automatically.\n\nMarkdown:"
- If you want your page to validate under XHTML
- "1.0 Strict,"
- "you've got to put paragraph tags in your"
- "blockquotes:\n\n        <blockquote>"
- "<p>For example.</p>"
- "</blockquote>\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>If you want your page to validate under XHTML"
- "1.0 Strict,"
- "you've got to put paragraph tags in your"
- "blockquotes:</p>"
- "<pre><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;"
- "&lt;p&gt;For example.&lt;/p"
- "&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;"
- "</code></pre>"
