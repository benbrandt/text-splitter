- ROMEO.
- "Not having that which, having,"

- "ROMEO.\nOut.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nOf love?"
- ROMEO.
- Out of her favour where I am in

- BENVOLIO.
- Alas that love so gentle in his

- ROMEO.
- "Alas that love, whose view is"

- "Still-waking sleep, that is not"
- ", that is not what it is!"
- "This love feel I, that feel no"
- "I, that feel no love in this."
- Dost thou not laugh?
- "BENVOLIO.\nNo coz, I rather weep."
- "ROMEO.\nGood heart, at what?"
- BENVOLIO.
- At thy good heart’s oppression.
- ROMEO.
- Why such is love’s transgression
- transgression.
- Griefs of mine own lie heavy in
- "own lie heavy in my breast,"
- Which thou wilt propagate to
- propagate to have it prest
- With more of thine.
- This love that thou hast shown
- Doth add more grief to too much
- to too much of mine own.
- Love is a smoke made with the

- "Being purg’d, a fire sparkling"
- a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes
- in lovers’ eyes;
- "Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d"
- a sea nourish’d with lovers’
- "with lovers’ tears:"
- What is it else?
- "A madness most discreet,"
- "A choking gall, and a preserving"
- and a preserving sweet.
- "Farewell, my coz.\n\n [_Going._]"
- "BENVOLIO.\nSoft! I will go along:"
- "And if you leave me so, you do"
- "me so, you do me wrong."
- ROMEO.
- Tut!
- I have lost myself; I am not

- Tell me in sadness who is that

- ROMEO.
- "What, shall I groan and tell"
- I groan and tell thee?
- BENVOLIO.
- Groan!
- "Why, no; but sadly tell me who."
- ROMEO.
- Bid a sick man in sadness make

- BENVOLIO.
- "A right fair mark, fair coz, is"
- ", fair coz, is soonest hit."
- ROMEO.
- "Well, in that hit you miss:"
- "hit you miss: she’ll not be hit"
- "With Cupid’s arrow, she hath"
- "arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;"
- And in strong proof of chastity
- "of chastity well arm’d,"
- From love’s weak childish bow
- childish bow she lives uncharm’d
- lives uncharm’d.
- She will not stay the siege of
- the siege of loving terms
- Nor bide th’encounter of
- "th’encounter of assailing eyes,"
- Nor ope her lap to saint-

- "O she’s rich in beauty, only"
- "in beauty, only poor"
- "That when she dies, with beauty"
- ", with beauty dies her store."
- BENVOLIO.
- Then she hath sworn that she
- sworn that she will still live
- will still live chaste?
- ROMEO.
- "She hath, and in that sparing"
- in that sparing makes huge waste
- makes huge waste;
- For beauty starv’d with her
- "starv’d with her severity,"
- Cuts beauty off from all
- off from all posterity.
- "She is too fair, too wise;"
- "fair, too wise; wisely too fair,"
- To merit bliss by making me
- by making me despair.
- "She hath forsworn to love, and"
- "to love, and in that vow"
- "Do I live dead, that live to"
- ", that live to tell it now."
- BENVOLIO.
- "Be rul’d by me, forget to think"
- forget to think of her.
- ROMEO.
- O teach me how I should forget
- I should forget to think.
- BENVOLIO.
- By giving liberty unto thine
- unto thine eyes;
- Examine other beauties.
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis the way"
- "To call hers, exquisite, in"
- ", exquisite, in question more."
- These happy masks that kiss fair
- "that kiss fair ladies’ brows,"
- "Being black, puts us in mind"
- puts us in mind they hide the
- they hide the fair;
- He that is strucken blind cannot
- blind cannot forget
- The precious treasure of his
- treasure of his eyesight lost.
- Show me a mistress that is
- "mistress that is passing fair,"
- What doth her beauty serve but
- beauty serve but as a note
- Where I may read who pass’d that
- who pass’d that passing fair?
- "Farewell, thou canst not teach"

- BENVOLIO.

- "O, she doth teach the torches to"

- It seems she hangs upon the

- As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s
- in an Ethiop’s ear;

- "for use, for earth too dear!"
- So shows a snowy dove trooping

- Appear thou in the likeness of a

- "He heareth not, he stirreth not,"
- "he stirreth not, he moveth not;"
- "The ape is dead, and I must"
- "dead, and I must conjure him."
- I conjure thee by Rosaline’s
- "by Rosaline’s bright eyes,"
- By her high forehead and her
- "forehead and her scarlet lip,"
- "By her fine foot, straight leg,"
- ", straight leg, and quivering"
- ", and quivering thigh,"
- And the demesnes that there
- "that there adjacent lie,"
- That in thy likeness thou appear
- thou appear to us.
- BENVOLIO.
- "An if he hear thee, thou wilt"
- "thee, thou wilt anger him."
- MERCUTIO.
- This cannot anger him.
- ’Twould anger him
- To raise a spirit in his
- a spirit in his mistress’ circle
- "mistress’ circle,"
- "Of some strange nature, letting"
- "nature, letting it there stand"
- "Till she had laid it, and"
- "had laid it, and conjur’d it"

- An open-arse and thou a poperin

- "Romeo, good night."
- I’ll to my truckle-bed.
- This field-bed is too cold for

- "Come, shall we go?"
- BENVOLIO.
- Go then; for ’tis in vain
- To seek him here that means not

- SCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.
- Enter Romeo.
- ROMEO.
- He jests at scars that never
- scars that never felt a wound.
- Juliet appears above at a window
- at a window.
- "But soft, what light through"
- light through yonder window
- yonder window breaks?
- "It is the east, and Juliet is"
- ", and Juliet is the sun!"
- Arise fair sun and kill the
- "sun and kill the envious moon,"
- Who is already sick and pale
- "sick and pale with grief,"
- That thou her maid art far more
- art far more fair than she.
- Be not her maid since she is
- since she is envious;
- Her vestal livery is but sick
- "is but sick and green,"
- And none but fools do wear it;
- do wear it; cast it off.
- "It is my lady, O it is my love!"
- "O, that she knew she were!"
- "She speaks, yet she says nothing"
- she says nothing. What of that?
- "Her eye discourses, I will"
- ", I will answer it."
- "I am too bold, ’tis not to me"
- ", ’tis not to me she speaks."
- Two of the fairest stars in all
- "stars in all the heaven,"
- "Having some business, do entreat"
- ", do entreat her eyes"
- To twinkle in their spheres till
- spheres till they return.
- "What if her eyes were there,"
- "eyes were there, they in her"
- ", they in her head?"
- The brightness of her cheek
- of her cheek would shame those
- "shame those stars,"
- As daylight doth a lamp; her
- doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
- Would through the airy region
- the airy region stream so bright
- That birds would sing and think
- sing and think it were not night
- were not night.
- See how she leans her cheek upon
- her cheek upon her hand.
- O that I were a glove upon that
- "glove upon that hand,"
- That I might touch that cheek.
- "JULIET.\nAy me."
- "ROMEO.\nShe speaks."
- "O speak again bright angel, for"
- "angel, for thou art"
- "As glorious to this night, being"
- "night, being o’er my head,"
- As is a winged messenger of
- messenger of heaven
- Unto the white-upturned
- white-upturned wondering eyes
- Of mortals that fall back to
- fall back to gaze on him
- When he bestrides the lazy-
- the lazy-puffing clouds
- And sails upon the bosom of the
- the bosom of the air.
- JULIET.
- "O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art"
- ", wherefore art thou Romeo?"
- Deny thy father and refuse thy
- and refuse thy name.
- "Or if thou wilt not, be but"
- "wilt not, be but sworn my love,"
- And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
- ROMEO.
- "[_Aside."
- "_] Shall I hear more, or shall I"
- "more, or shall I speak at this?"
- JULIET.
- ’Tis but thy name that is my
- name that is my enemy;
- "Thou art thyself, though not a"
- ", though not a Montague."
- What’s Montague?
- "It is nor hand nor foot,"
- "Nor arm, nor face, nor any other"
- ", nor any other part"
- Belonging to a man.
- O be some other name.
- What’s in a name?
- That which we call a rose
- By any other name would smell as
- would smell as sweet;
- "So Romeo would, were he not"
- ", were he not Romeo call’d,"
- Retain that dear perfection
- dear perfection which he owes
- Without that title.
- "Romeo, doff thy name,"
- "And for thy name, which is no"
- ", which is no part of thee,"
- Take all myself.
- "ROMEO.\nI take thee at thy word."
- "Call me but love, and I’ll be"
- ", and I’ll be new baptis’d;"
- Henceforth I never will be Romeo
- will be Romeo.
- JULIET.
- "What man art thou that, thus"
- "thou that, thus bescreen’d in"
- bescreen’d in night
- So stumblest on my counsel?
- "ROMEO.\nBy a name"
- I know not how to tell thee who
- "to tell thee who I am:"
- "My name, dear saint, is hateful"
- ", is hateful to myself,"
- Because it is an enemy to thee.
- "Had I it written, I would tear"
- ", I would tear the word."
- JULIET.
- My ears have yet not drunk a
- yet not drunk a hundred words
- "Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I"
- "utterance, yet I know the sound."
- "Art thou not Romeo, and a"
- "not Romeo, and a Montague?"
- ROMEO.
- "Neither, fair maid, if either"
- "maid, if either thee dislike."
- JULIET.
- "How cam’st thou hither, tell me,"
- "hither, tell me, and wherefore?"
- The orchard walls are high and
- "are high and hard to climb,"
- "And the place death, considering"
- ", considering who thou art,"
- If any of my kinsmen find thee
- find thee here.
- ROMEO.
- With love’s light wings did I
- wings did I o’erperch these
- "o’erperch these walls,"
- For stony limits cannot hold
- "cannot hold love out,"
- "And what love can do, that dares"
- "do, that dares love attempt:"
- Therefore thy kinsmen are no
- kinsmen are no stop to me.
- JULIET.
- "If they do see thee, they will"
- "thee, they will murder thee."
- ROMEO.
- "Alack, there lies more peril in"
- more peril in thine eye
- Than twenty of their swords.
- "Look thou but sweet,"
- And I am proof against their
- against their enmity.
- JULIET.
- I would not for the world they
- the world they saw thee here.
- ROMEO.
- I have night’s cloak to hide me
- cloak to hide me from their eyes
- "from their eyes,"
- "And but thou love me, let them"
- "me, let them find me here."
- My life were better ended by
- better ended by their hate
- "Than death prorogued, wanting of"
- ", wanting of thy love."
- JULIET.
- By whose direction found’st thou
- found’st thou out this place?
- ROMEO.
- "By love, that first did prompt"
- first did prompt me to enquire;
- "He lent me counsel, and I lent"
- ", and I lent him eyes."
- I am no pilot; yet wert thou as
- yet wert thou as far
- As that vast shore wash’d with
- "wash’d with the farthest sea,"
- I should adventure for such
- for such merchandise.
- JULIET.
- Thou knowest the mask of night
- "mask of night is on my face,"
- Else would a maiden blush
- a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
- For that which thou hast heard
- thou hast heard me speak tonight
- me speak tonight.
- "Fain would I dwell on form, fain"
- "on form, fain, fain deny"
- What I have spoke; but farewell
- ; but farewell compliment.
- Dost thou love me?
- "I know thou wilt say Ay,"
- And I will take thy word.
- "Yet, if thou swear’st,"
- Thou mayst prove false.
- "At lovers’ perjuries,"
- They say Jove laughs.
- "O gentle Romeo,"
- "If thou dost love, pronounce it"
- ", pronounce it faithfully."
- Or if thou thinkest I am too
- "I am too quickly won,"
- "I’ll frown and be perverse, and"
- "be perverse, and say thee nay,"
- So thou wilt woo.
- "But else, not for the world."
- "In truth, fair Montague, I am"
- "Montague, I am too fond;"
- And therefore thou mayst think
- thou mayst think my ’haviour
- "my ’haviour light:"
- "But trust me, gentleman, I’ll"
- "gentleman, I’ll prove more true"
- Than those that have more
- that have more cunning to be
- cunning to be strange.
- "I should have been more strange,"
- "more strange, I must confess,"
- "But that thou overheard’st, ere"
- ", ere I was ’ware,"
- My true-love passion; therefore
- "; therefore pardon me,"
- And not impute this yielding to
- "this yielding to light love,"
- Which the dark night hath so
- night hath so discovered.
- ROMEO.
- "Lady, by yonder blessed moon I"
- "blessed moon I vow,"
- That tips with silver all these
- silver all these fruit-tree tops
- "fruit-tree tops,—"
- JULIET.
- "O swear not by the moon,"
- "not by the moon, th’inconstant"
- ", th’inconstant moon,"
- That monthly changes in her
- "changes in her circled orb,"
- Lest that thy love prove
- thy love prove likewise variable
- variable.
- "ROMEO.\nWhat shall I swear by?"
- "JULIET.\nDo not swear at all."
- "Or if thou wilt, swear by thy"
- ", swear by thy gracious self,"
- "Which is the god of my idolatry,"
- And I’ll believe thee.
- "ROMEO.\nIf my heart’s dear love,—"
- JULIET.
- "Well, do not swear."
- "Although I joy in thee,"
- I have no joy of this contract
- of this contract tonight;
- "It is too rash, too unadvis’d,"
- ", too unadvis’d, too sudden,"
- "Too like the lightning, which"
- "lightning, which doth cease to"
- doth cease to be
- Ere one can say It lightens.
- "Sweet, good night."
- "This bud of love, by summer’s"
- ", by summer’s ripening breath,"
- May prove a beauteous flower
- beauteous flower when next we
- when next we meet.
- "Good night, good night."
- As sweet repose and rest
- Come to thy heart as that within
- as that within my breast.
- ROMEO.
- O wilt thou leave me so
- thou leave me so unsatisfied?
- JULIET.
- What satisfaction canst thou
- canst thou have tonight?
- ROMEO.
- Th’exchange of thy love’s
- of thy love’s faithful vow for
- faithful vow for mine.
- JULIET.
- I gave thee mine before thou
- mine before thou didst request
- didst request it;
- And yet I would it were to give
- it were to give again.
- ROMEO.
- Would’st thou withdraw it?
- "For what purpose, love?"
- JULIET.
- But to be frank and give it thee
- and give it thee again.
- And yet I wish but for the thing
- for the thing I have;
- My bounty is as boundless as the
- "boundless as the sea,"
- My love as deep; the more I give
- "the more I give to thee,"
- "The more I have, for both are"
- ", for both are infinite."
- I hear some noise within.
- "Dear love, adieu."
- "[_Nurse calls within._]"
- "Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague"
- "!—Sweet Montague be true."
- "Stay but a little, I will come"
- ", I will come again.\n\n [_Exit._]"
- ROMEO.
- "O blessed, blessed night."
- "I am afeard,"
- "Being in night, all this is but"
- "all this is but a dream,"
- Too flattering sweet to be
- sweet to be substantial.
- Enter Juliet above.
- JULIET.
- "Three words, dear Romeo, and"
- "dear Romeo, and good night"
- ", and good night indeed."
- If that thy bent of love be
- "bent of love be honourable,"
- "Thy purpose marriage, send me"
- ", send me word tomorrow,"
- By one that I’ll procure to come
- "procure to come to thee,"
- Where and what time thou wilt
- "time thou wilt perform the rite,"
- And all my fortunes at thy foot
- at thy foot I’ll lay
- And follow thee my lord
- thee my lord throughout the
- throughout the world.
- "NURSE.\n[_Within._] Madam."
- JULIET.
- "I come, anon.— But if thou"
- ".— But if thou meanest not well,"
- "I do beseech thee,—"
- "NURSE.\n[_Within._] Madam."
- "JULIET.\nBy and by I come—"
- To cease thy strife and leave me
- and leave me to my grief.
- Tomorrow will I send.
- "ROMEO.\nSo thrive my soul,—"
- JULIET.
- A thousand times good night.
- "[_Exit._]"
- ROMEO.
- "A thousand times the worse, to"
- "the worse, to want thy light."
- Love goes toward love as
- toward love as schoolboys from
- "schoolboys from their books,"
- "But love from love, towards"
- "love, towards school with heavy"
- with heavy looks.
- "[_Retiring slowly._]"
- "Re-enter Juliet, above."
- JULIET.
- "Hist! Romeo, hist!"
- O for a falconer’s voice
- To lure this tassel-gentle back
- "-gentle back again."
- Bondage is hoarse and may not
- "and may not speak aloud,"
- Else would I tear the cave where
- "the cave where Echo lies,"
- And make her airy tongue more
- airy tongue more hoarse than
- more hoarse than mine
- With repetition of my Romeo’s
- of my Romeo’s name.
- ROMEO.
- It is my soul that calls upon my
- calls upon my name.
- How silver-sweet sound lovers’
- "sound lovers’ tongues by night,"
- Like softest music to attending
- to attending ears.
- "JULIET.\nRomeo.\n\nROMEO.\nMy nyas?"
- "JULIET.\nWhat o’clock tomorrow"
- Shall I send to thee?
- "ROMEO.\nBy the hour of nine."
- JULIET.
- I will not fail.
- ’Tis twenty years till then.
- I have forgot why I did call
- why I did call thee back.
- ROMEO.
- Let me stand here till thou
- here till thou remember it.
- JULIET.
- "I shall forget, to have thee"
- ", to have thee still stand there"
- "stand there,"
- Remembering how I love thy
- how I love thy company.
- ROMEO.
- "And I’ll still stay, to have"
- "stay, to have thee still forget,"
- Forgetting any other home but
- other home but this.
- JULIET.
- ’Tis almost morning; I would
- "morning; I would have thee gone,"
- And yet no farther than a
- "farther than a wanton’s bird,"
- That lets it hop a little from
- "a little from her hand,"
- Like a poor prisoner in his
- "prisoner in his twisted gyves,"
- And with a silk thread plucks it
- "thread plucks it back again,"
- So loving-jealous of his liberty

- Yet let me weep for such a

- JULIET.
- Indeed I never shall be

- "It shall be Romeo, whom you know"
- ", whom you know I hate,"
- Rather than Paris.

- Ancient damnation!

- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- You say you do not know the

- Uneven is the course; I like it
- ; I like it not.
- PARIS.
- Immoderately she weeps for
- "she weeps for Tybalt’s death,"
- And therefore have I little
- have I little talk’d of love;
- For Venus smiles not in a house
- not in a house of tears.
- "Now, sir, her father counts it"
- father counts it dangerous
- That she do give her sorrow so
- her sorrow so much sway;
- "And in his wisdom, hastes our"

- PARIS.
- "Poor soul, thy face is much"

- Thou wrong’st it more than tears

- "Shall play the empire,"
- "play the empire, arbitrating"

- Which the commission of thy

- Could to no issue of true honour

- Be not so long to speak.
- "I long to die,"
- If what thou speak’st speak not
- speak not of remedy.
- FRIAR LAWRENCE.
- "Hold, daughter."
- "I do spy a kind of hope,"
- Which craves as desperate an
- as desperate an execution
- As that is desperate which we
- which we would prevent.
- "If, rather than to marry County"
- to marry County Paris
- Thou hast the strength of will
- strength of will to slay thyself

- Then is it likely thou wilt

- A thing like death to chide away
- "to chide away this shame,"
- That cop’st with death himself

- "in a charnel-house,"
- O’er-cover’d quite with dead
- quite with dead men’s rattling
- "men’s rattling bones,"
- With reeky shanks and yellow
- and yellow chapless skulls.
- Or bid me go into a new-made

- And hide me with a dead man in

- And I will do it without fear or

- Wednesday is tomorrow;
- Tomorrow night look that thou
