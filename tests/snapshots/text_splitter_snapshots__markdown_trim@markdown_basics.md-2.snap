- "Getting the Gist of Markdown's Formatting Syntax\n------------------------------------------------"
- "This page offers a brief overview of what it's like to use Markdown."
- "The [syntax page] [s] provides complete, detailed documentation for"
- "every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by"
- looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page
- "are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the"
- HTML output produced by Markdown.
- "It's also helpful to simply try Markdown out; the [Dingus] [d] is a"
- web application that allows you type your own Markdown-formatted text
- "and translate it to XHTML.\n\n**Note:** This document is itself written using Markdown; you"
- "can [see the source for it by adding '.text' to the URL] [src]."
- "[s]: /projects/markdown/syntax  \"Markdown Syntax\""
- "[d]: /projects/markdown/dingus  \"Markdown Dingus\"\n  [src]: /projects/markdown/basics.text"
- "## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ##"
- "A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated"
- by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like
- a blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is
- considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with
- "spaces or tabs.\n\nMarkdown offers two styles of headers: *Setext* and *atx*."
- "Setext-style headers for `<h1>` and `<h2>` are created by"
- "\"underlining\" with equal signs (`=`) and hyphens (`-`), respectively."
- "To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (`#`) at the"
- beginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting
- "HTML header level.\n\nBlockquotes are indicated using email-style '`>`' angle brackets.\n\nMarkdown:"
- "A First Level Header\n    ====================\n\n    A Second Level Header\n    ---------------------"
- "Now is the time for all good men to come to\n    the aid of their country. This is just a"
- "regular paragraph.\n\n    The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy\n    dog's back.\n\n    ### Header 3"
- "> This is a blockquote.\n    >\n    > This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.\n    >"
- "> ## This is an H2 in a blockquote\n\n\nOutput:\n\n    <h1>A First Level Header</h1>"
- "<h2>A Second Level Header</h2>\n\n    <p>Now is the time for all good men to come to"
- "the aid of their country. This is just a\n    regular paragraph.</p>"
- "<p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy\n    dog's back.</p>\n\n    <h3>Header 3</h3>"
- "<blockquote>\n        <p>This is a blockquote.</p>"
- "<p>This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.</p>"
- "<h2>This is an H2 in a blockquote</h2>\n    </blockquote>\n\n\n\n### Phrase Emphasis ###"
- "Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis.\n\nMarkdown:"
- "Some of these words *are emphasized*.\n    Some of these words _are emphasized also_."
- "Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.\n    Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__."
- "Output:\n\n    <p>Some of these words <em>are emphasized</em>."
- Some of these words <em>are emphasized also</em>.</p>
- "<p>Use two asterisks for <strong>strong emphasis</strong>."
- "Or, if you prefer, <strong>use two underscores instead</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n## Lists ##"
- "Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`,"
- "`+`, and `-`) as list markers. These three markers are"
- "interchangable; this:\n\n    *   Candy.\n    *   Gum.\n    *   Booze.\n\nthis:\n\n    +   Candy."
- "+   Gum.\n    +   Booze.\n\nand this:\n\n    -   Candy.\n    -   Gum.\n    -   Booze."
- "all produce the same output:\n\n    <ul>\n    <li>Candy.</li>\n    <li>Gum.</li>\n    <li>Booze.</li>"
- "</ul>\n\nOrdered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as"
- "list markers:\n\n    1.  Red\n    2.  Green\n    3.  Blue\n\nOutput:\n\n    <ol>\n    <li>Red</li>"
- "<li>Green</li>\n    <li>Blue</li>\n    </ol>"
- "If you put blank lines between items, you'll get `<p>` tags for the"
- list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting
- "the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab:\n\n    *   A list item.\n\n        With multiple paragraphs."
- "*   Another item in the list.\n\nOutput:\n\n    <ul>\n    <li><p>A list item.</p>"
- "<p>With multiple paragraphs.</p></li>\n    <li><p>Another item in the list.</p></li>\n    </ul>"
- "### Links ###\n\nMarkdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and"
- "*reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the"
- text you want to turn into a link.
- Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.
- "For example:\n\n    This is an [example link](http://example.com/).\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>This is an <a href=\"http://example.com/\">\n    example link</a>.</p>"
- "Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:"
- "This is an [example link](http://example.com/ \"With a Title\").\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>This is an <a href=\"http://example.com/\" title=\"With a Title\">\n    example link</a>.</p>"
- "Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which"
- "you define elsewhere in your document:\n\n    I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from"
- "[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].\n\n    [1]: http://google.com/        \"Google\""
- "[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\"\n    [3]: http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\""
- "Output:\n\n    <p>I get 10 times more traffic from <a href=\"http://google.com/\""
- "title=\"Google\">Google</a> than from <a href=\"http://search.yahoo.com/\""
- "title=\"Yahoo Search\">Yahoo</a> or <a href=\"http://search.msn.com/\""
- "title=\"MSN Search\">MSN</a>.</p>\n\nThe title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters,"
- "numbers and spaces, but are *not* case sensitive:\n\n    I start my morning with a cup of coffee and"
- "[The New York Times][NY Times].\n\n    [ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>I start my morning with a cup of coffee and"
- "<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">The New York Times</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Images ###"
- "Image syntax is very much like link syntax.\n\nInline (titles are optional):\n\n    !["
- "alt text](/path/to/img.jpg \"Title\")\n\nReference-style:\n\n    ![alt text][id]"
- "[id]: /path/to/img.jpg \"Title\"\n\nBoth of the above examples produce the same output:"
- "<img src=\"/path/to/img.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Title\" />\n\n\n\n### Code ###"
- "In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in"
- "backtick quotes. Any ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` or"
- "`>`) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes"
- "it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:"
- "I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags."
- "I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`"
- "instead of decimal-encoded entities like `&#8212;`.\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>I strongly recommend against using any\n    <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tags.</p>"
- "<p>I wish SmartyPants used named entities like"
- "<code>&amp;mdash;</code> instead of decimal-encoded\n    entities like <code>&amp;#8212;</code>.</p>"
- "To specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of"
- "the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&`, `<`,"
- "and `>` characters will be escaped automatically.\n\nMarkdown:"
- "If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,"
- "you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:\n\n        <blockquote>"
- "<p>For example.</p>\n        </blockquote>\n\nOutput:"
- "<p>If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,"
- "you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:</p>\n\n    <pre><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;"
- "&lt;p&gt;For example.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    </code></pre>"
