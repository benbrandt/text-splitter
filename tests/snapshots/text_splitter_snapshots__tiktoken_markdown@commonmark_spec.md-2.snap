- "# Introduction\n\n"
- "## What is Markdown?\n\nMarkdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents,\nbased on conventions for indicating formatting in email\nand usenet posts.  It was developed by John Gruber (with\nhelp from Aaron Swartz) and released in 2004 in the form of a\n[syntax description](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\nand a Perl script (`Markdown.pl`) for converting Markdown to\nHTML.  In the next decade, dozens of implementations were\ndeveloped in many languages.  Some extended the original\nMarkdown syntax with conventions for footnotes, tables, and\nother document elements.  Some allowed Markdown documents to be\nrendered in formats other than HTML.  Websites like Reddit,\nStackOverflow, and GitHub had millions of people using Markdown.\nAnd Markdown started to be used beyond the web, to author books,\narticles, slide shows, letters, and lecture notes.\n\nWhat distinguishes Markdown from many other lightweight markup\nsyntaxes, which are often easier to write, is its readability.\nAs Gruber writes:\n"
- "\n> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is\n> to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a\n> Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as\n> plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags\n> or formatting instructions.\n> (<https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>)\n\nThe point can be illustrated by comparing a sample of\n[AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) with\nan equivalent sample of Markdown.  Here is a sample of\nAsciiDoc from the AsciiDoc manual:\n\n```\n1. List item one.\n+\nList item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an\nIndented block.\n+\n.................\n$ ls *.sh\n$ mv *.sh ~/tmp\n.................\n+\nList item continued with a third paragraph.\n\n2. List item two continued with an open block.\n+\n--\nThis paragraph is part of the preceding list item.\n\na. This list is nested and does not require explicit item\ncontinuation.\n+\nThis paragraph is part of the preceding list item.\n\nb. List item b.\n\nThis paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.\n--\n```\n\nAnd here is the equivalent in Markdown:\n"
- "```\n1.  List item one.\n\n    List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an\n    Indented block.\n\n        $ ls *.sh\n        $ mv *.sh ~/tmp\n\n    List item continued with a third paragraph.\n\n2.  List item two continued with an open block.\n\n    This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.\n\n    1. This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.\n\n       This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.\n\n    2. List item b.\n\n    This paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.\n```\n\nThe AsciiDoc version is, arguably, easier to write. You don't need\nto worry about indentation.  But the Markdown version is much easier\nto read.  The nesting of list items is apparent to the eye in the\nsource, not just in the processed document.\n\n"
- "## Why is a spec needed?\n\nJohn Gruber's [canonical description of Markdown's\nsyntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\ndoes not specify the syntax unambiguously.  Here are some examples of\nquestions it does not answer:\n"
- "\n1.  How much indentation is needed for a sublist?  The spec says that\n    continuation paragraphs need to be indented four spaces, but is\n    not fully explicit about sublists.  It is natural to think that\n    they, too, must be indented four spaces, but `Markdown.pl` does\n    not require that.  This is hardly a \"corner case,\" and divergences\n    between implementations on this issue often lead to surprises for\n    users in real documents. (See [this comment by John\n    Gruber](https://web.archive.org/web/20170611172104/http://article.gmane.org/gmane.text.markdown.general/1997).)\n\n"
- "2.  Is a blank line needed before a block quote or heading?\n    Most implementations do not require the blank line.  However,\n    this can lead to unexpected results in hard-wrapped text, and\n    also to ambiguities in parsing (note that some implementations\n    put the heading inside the blockquote, while others do not).\n    (John Gruber has also spoken [in favor of requiring the blank\n    lines](https://web.archive.org/web/20170611172104/http://article.gmane.org/gmane.text.markdown.general/2146).)\n\n3.  Is a blank line needed before an indented code block?\n    (`Markdown.pl` requires it, but this is not mentioned in the\n    documentation, and some implementations do not require it.)\n\n    ``` markdown\n    paragraph\n        code?\n    ```\n\n"
- "4.  What is the exact rule for determining when list items get\n    wrapped in `<p>` tags?  Can a list be partially \"loose\" and partially\n    \"tight\"?  What should we do with a list like this?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    1. one\n\n    2. two\n    3. three\n    ```\n\n    Or this?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    1.  one\n        - a\n\n        - b\n    2.  two\n    ```\n\n    (There are some relevant comments by John Gruber\n    [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170611172104/http://article.gmane.org/gmane.text.markdown.general/2554).)\n\n5.  Can list markers be indented?  Can ordered list markers be right-aligned?\n\n    ``` markdown\n     8. item 1\n     9. item 2\n    10. item 2a\n    ```\n\n6.  Is this one list with a thematic break in its second item,\n    or two lists separated by a thematic break?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    * a\n    * * * * *\n    * b\n    ```\n\n"
- "7.  When list markers change from numbers to bullets, do we have\n    two lists or one?  (The Markdown syntax description suggests two,\n    but the perl scripts and many other implementations produce one.)\n\n    ``` markdown\n    1. fee\n    2. fie\n    -  foe\n    -  fum\n    ```\n\n8.  What are the precedence rules for the markers of inline structure?\n    For example, is the following a valid link, or does the code span\n    take precedence ?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    [a backtick (`)](/url) and [another backtick (`)](/url).\n    ```\n\n9.  What are the precedence rules for markers of emphasis and strong\n    emphasis?  For example, how should the following be parsed?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    *foo *bar* baz*\n    ```\n\n10. What are the precedence rules between block-level and inline-level\n    structure?  For example, how should the following be parsed?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    - `a long code span can contain a hyphen like this\n      - and it can screw things up`\n    ```\n\n"
- "11. Can list items include section headings?  (`Markdown.pl` does not\n    allow this, but does allow blockquotes to include headings.)\n\n    ``` markdown\n    - # Heading\n    ```\n\n12. Can list items be empty?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    * a\n    *\n    * b\n    ```\n\n13. Can link references be defined inside block quotes or list items?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    > Blockquote [foo].\n    >\n    > [foo]: /url\n    ```\n\n14. If there are multiple definitions for the same reference, which takes\n    precedence?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    [foo]: /url1\n    [foo]: /url2\n\n    [foo][]\n    ```\n\nIn the absence of a spec, early implementers consulted `Markdown.pl`\nto resolve these ambiguities.  But `Markdown.pl` was quite buggy, and\ngave manifestly bad results in many cases, so it was not a\nsatisfactory replacement for a spec.\n"
- "\nBecause there is no unambiguous spec, implementations have diverged\nconsiderably.  As a result, users are often surprised to find that\na document that renders one way on one system (say, a GitHub wiki)\nrenders differently on another (say, converting to docbook using\npandoc).  To make matters worse, because nothing in Markdown counts\nas a \"syntax error,\" the divergence often isn't discovered right away.\n\n"
- "## About this document\n\nThis document attempts to specify Markdown syntax unambiguously.\nIt contains many examples with side-by-side Markdown and\nHTML.  These are intended to double as conformance tests.  An\naccompanying script `spec_tests.py` can be used to run the tests\nagainst any Markdown program:\n\n    python test/spec_tests.py --spec spec.txt --program PROGRAM\n\nSince this document describes how Markdown is to be parsed into\nan abstract syntax tree, it would have made sense to use an abstract\nrepresentation of the syntax tree instead of HTML.  But HTML is capable\nof representing the structural distinctions we need to make, and the\nchoice of HTML for the tests makes it possible to run the tests against\nan implementation without writing an abstract syntax tree renderer.\n"
- "\nNote that not every feature of the HTML samples is mandated by\nthe spec.  For example, the spec says what counts as a link\ndestination, but it doesn't mandate that non-ASCII characters in\nthe URL be percent-encoded.  To use the automatic tests,\nimplementers will need to provide a renderer that conforms to\nthe expectations of the spec examples (percent-encoding\nnon-ASCII characters in URLs).  But a conforming implementation\ncan use a different renderer and may choose not to\npercent-encode non-ASCII characters in URLs.\n\nThis document is generated from a text file, `spec.txt`, written\nin Markdown with a small extension for the side-by-side tests.\nThe script `tools/makespec.py` can be used to convert `spec.txt` into\nHTML or CommonMark (which can then be converted into other formats).\n\nIn the examples, the `→` character is used to represent tabs.\n\n"
- "# Preliminaries\n\n"
- "## Characters and lines\n\nAny sequence of [characters] is a valid CommonMark\ndocument.\n\nA [character](@) is a Unicode code point.  Although some\ncode points (for example, combining accents) do not correspond to\ncharacters in an intuitive sense, all code points count as characters\nfor purposes of this spec.\n\nThis spec does not specify an encoding; it thinks of lines as composed\nof [characters] rather than bytes.  A conforming parser may be limited\nto a certain encoding.\n\nA [line](@) is a sequence of zero or more [characters]\nother than line feed (`U+000A`) or carriage return (`U+000D`),\nfollowed by a [line ending] or by the end of file.\n\nA [line ending](@) is a line feed (`U+000A`), a carriage return\n(`U+000D`) not followed by a line feed, or a carriage return and a\nfollowing line feed.\n\nA line containing no characters, or a line containing only spaces\n(`U+0020`) or tabs (`U+0009`), is called a [blank line](@).\n\nThe following definitions of character classes will be used in this spec:\n"
- "\nA [Unicode whitespace character](@) is a character in the Unicode `Zs` general\ncategory, or a tab (`U+0009`), line feed (`U+000A`), form feed (`U+000C`), or\ncarriage return (`U+000D`).\n\n[Unicode whitespace](@) is a sequence of one or more\n[Unicode whitespace characters].\n\nA [tab](@) is `U+0009`.\n\nA [space](@) is `U+0020`.\n\nAn [ASCII control character](@) is a character between `U+0000–1F` (both\nincluding) or `U+007F`.\n"
- "\nAn [ASCII punctuation character](@)\nis `!`, `\"`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`,\n`*`, `+`, `,`, `-`, `.`, `/` (U+0021–2F), \n`:`, `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `?`, `@` (U+003A–0040),\n`[`, `\\`, `]`, `^`, `_`, `` ` `` (U+005B–0060), \n`{`, `|`, `}`, or `~` (U+007B–007E).\n\nA [Unicode punctuation character](@) is a character in the Unicode `P`\n(puncuation) or `S` (symbol) general categories.\n\n"
- "## Tabs\n\nTabs in lines are not expanded to [spaces].  However,\nin contexts where spaces help to define block structure,\ntabs behave as if they were replaced by spaces with a tab stop\nof 4 characters.\n\nThus, for example, a tab can be used instead of four spaces\nin an indented code block.  (Note, however, that internal\ntabs are passed through as literal tabs, not expanded to\nspaces.)\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n→foo→baz→→bim\n.\n<pre><code>foo→baz→→bim\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n  →foo→baz→→bim\n.\n<pre><code>foo→baz→→bim\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````"

- "\n\nNormally the `>` that begins a block quote may be followed\noptionally by a space, which is not considered part of the\ncontent.  In the following case `>` is followed by a tab,\nwhich is treated as if it were expanded into three spaces.\nSince one of these spaces is considered part of the\ndelimiter, `foo` is considered to be indented six spaces\ninside the block quote context, so we get an indented\ncode block starting with two spaces.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n>→→foo\n.\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>  foo\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n-→→foo\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  foo\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````"

- "\nThere is one respect, however, in which Gruber's rule is more liberal\nthan the one given here, since it allows blank lines to occur inside\nan HTML block.  There are two reasons for disallowing them here.\nFirst, it removes the need to parse balanced tags, which is\nexpensive and can require backtracking from the end of the document\nif no matching end tag is found. Second, it provides a very simple\nand flexible way of including Markdown content inside HTML tags:\nsimply separate the Markdown from the HTML using blank lines:\n\nCompare:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<div>\n\n*Emphasized* text.\n\n</div>\n.\n<div>\n<p><em>Emphasized</em> text.</p>\n</div>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<div>\n*Emphasized* text.\n</div>\n.\n<div>\n*Emphasized* text.\n</div>\n````````````````````````````````"

The rule given above seems a simpler and\nmore elegant way of achieving the same expressive power, which is also\nmuch simpler to parse.\n\nThe main potential drawback is that one can no longer paste HTML\nblocks into Markdown documents with 100% reliability.  However,\n*in most cases* this will work fine, because the blank lines in\nHTML are usually followed by HTML block tags.  For example:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\nHi\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n.\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\nHi\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThere are problems, however, if the inner tags are indented\n*and* separated by spaces, as then they will be interpreted as\nan indented code block:\n"

- "### Motivation\n\nJohn Gruber's Markdown spec says the following about list items:\n\n1. \"List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented\n   by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more\n   spaces or a tab.\"\n\n2. \"To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents....\n   But if you don't want to, you don't have to.\"\n\n3. \"List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent\n   paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one\n   tab.\"\n\n4. \"It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs,\n   but here again, Markdown will allow you to be lazy.\"\n\n5. \"To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote's `>`\n   delimiters need to be indented.\"\n\n6. \"To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be\n   indented twice — 8 spaces or two tabs.\"\n\n"
- "These rules specify that a paragraph under a list item must be indented\nfour spaces (presumably, from the left margin, rather than the start of\nthe list marker, but this is not said), and that code under a list item\nmust be indented eight spaces instead of the usual four.  They also say\nthat a block quote must be indented, but not by how much; however, the\nexample given has four spaces indentation.  Although nothing is said\nabout other kinds of block-level content, it is certainly reasonable to\ninfer that *all* block elements under a list item, including other\nlists, must be indented four spaces.  This principle has been called the\n*four-space rule*.\n"
- "\nThe four-space rule is clear and principled, and if the reference\nimplementation `Markdown.pl` had followed it, it probably would have\nbecome the standard.  However, `Markdown.pl` allowed paragraphs and\nsublists to start with only two spaces indentation, at least on the\nouter level.  Worse, its behavior was inconsistent: a sublist of an\nouter-level list needed two spaces indentation, but a sublist of this\nsublist needed three spaces.  It is not surprising, then, that different\nimplementations of Markdown have developed very different rules for\ndetermining what comes under a list item.  (Pandoc and python-Markdown,\nfor example, stuck with Gruber's syntax description and the four-space\nrule, while discount, redcarpet, marked, PHP Markdown, and others\nfollowed `Markdown.pl`'s behavior more closely.)\n"
- "\nUnfortunately, given the divergences between implementations, there\nis no way to give a spec for list items that will be guaranteed not\nto break any existing documents.  However, the spec given here should\ncorrectly handle lists formatted with either the four-space rule or\nthe more forgiving `Markdown.pl` behavior, provided they are laid out\nin a way that is natural for a human to read.\n\nThe strategy here is to let the width and indentation of the list marker\ndetermine the indentation necessary for blocks to fall under the list\nitem, rather than having a fixed and arbitrary number.  The writer can\nthink of the body of the list item as a unit which gets indented to the\nright enough to fit the list marker (and any indentation on the list\nmarker).  (The laziness rule, #5, then allows continuation lines to be\nunindented if needed.)\n\nThis rule is superior, we claim, to any rule requiring a fixed level of\nindentation from the margin.  The four-space rule is clear but\nunnatural. It is quite unintuitive that\n\n``` markdown\n- foo\n\n  bar\n\n  - baz\n```\n\nshould be parsed as two lists with an intervening paragraph,\n"
- "\n``` html\n<ul>\n<li>foo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>bar</p>\n<ul>\n<li>baz</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nas the four-space rule demands, rather than a single list,\n\n``` html\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>foo</p>\n<p>bar</p>\n<ul>\n<li>baz</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nThe choice of four spaces is arbitrary.  It can be learned, but it is\nnot likely to be guessed, and it trips up beginners regularly.\n\nWould it help to adopt a two-space rule?  The problem is that such\na rule, together with the rule allowing up to three spaces of indentation for\nthe initial list marker, allows text that is indented *less than* the\noriginal list marker to be included in the list item. For example,\n`Markdown.pl` parses\n\n``` markdown\n   - one\n\n  two\n```\n\nas a single list item, with `two` a continuation paragraph:\n\n``` html\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>one</p>\n<p>two</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nand similarly\n\n``` markdown\n>   - one\n>\n>  two\n```"
- "\n\nas\n\n``` html\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>one</p>\n<p>two</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n```\n\nThis is extremely unintuitive.\n\nRather than requiring a fixed indent from the margin, we could require\na fixed indent (say, two spaces, or even one space) from the list marker (which\nmay itself be indented).  This proposal would remove the last anomaly\ndiscussed.  Unlike the spec presented above, it would count the following\nas a list item with a subparagraph, even though the paragraph `bar`\nis not indented as far as the first paragraph `foo`:\n\n``` markdown\n 10. foo\n\n   bar  \n```\n\nArguably this text does read like a list item with `bar` as a subparagraph,\nwhich may count in favor of the proposal.  However, on this proposal indented\ncode would have to be indented six spaces after the list marker.  And this\nwould break a lot of existing Markdown, which has the pattern:\n\n``` markdown\n1.  foo\n\n        indented code\n```"
- "\n\nwhere the code is indented eight spaces.  The spec above, by contrast, will\nparse this text as expected, since the code block's indentation is measured\nfrom the beginning of `foo`.\n\nThe one case that needs special treatment is a list item that *starts*\nwith indented code.  How much indentation is required in that case, since\nwe don't have a \"first paragraph\" to measure from?  Rule #2 simply stipulates\nthat in such cases, we require one space indentation from the list marker\n(and then the normal four spaces for the indented code).  This will match the\nfour-space rule in cases where the list marker plus its initial indentation\ntakes four spaces (a common case), but diverge in other cases.\n\n"

- "## Emphasis and strong emphasis\n\nJohn Gruber's original [Markdown syntax\ndescription](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#em) says:\n\n> Markdown treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) as indicators of\n> emphasis. Text wrapped with one `*` or `_` will be wrapped with an HTML\n> `<em>` tag; double `*`'s or `_`'s will be wrapped with an HTML `<strong>`\n> tag.\n\nThis is enough for most users, but these rules leave much undecided,\nespecially when it comes to nested emphasis.  The original\n`Markdown.pl` test suite makes it clear that triple `***` and\n`___` delimiters can be used for strong emphasis, and most\nimplementations have also allowed the following patterns:\n\n``` markdown\n***strong emph***\n***strong** in emph*\n***emph* in strong**\n**in strong *emph***\n*in emph **strong***\n```\n\nThe following patterns are less widely supported, but the intent\nis clear and they are useful (especially in contexts like bibliography\nentries):\n\n``` markdown\n*emph *with emph* in it*\n**strong **with strong** in it**\n```"
- "\n\nMany implementations have also restricted intraword emphasis to\nthe `*` forms, to avoid unwanted emphasis in words containing\ninternal underscores.  (It is best practice to put these in code\nspans, but users often do not.)\n\n``` markdown\ninternal emphasis: foo*bar*baz\nno emphasis: foo_bar_baz\n```\n\nThe rules given below capture all of these patterns, while allowing\nfor efficient parsing strategies that do not backtrack.\n\nFirst, some definitions.  A [delimiter run](@) is either\na sequence of one or more `*` characters that is not preceded or\nfollowed by a non-backslash-escaped `*` character, or a sequence\nof one or more `_` characters that is not preceded or followed by\na non-backslash-escaped `_` character.\n"

- "\n1.  A single `*` character [can open emphasis](@)\n    iff (if and only if) it is part of a [left-flanking delimiter run].\n\n2.  A single `_` character [can open emphasis] iff\n    it is part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    and either (a) not part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    or (b) part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    preceded by a [Unicode punctuation character].\n\n3.

A double `**` [can open strong emphasis](@)\n    iff it is part of a [left-flanking delimiter run].\n\n"
- "6.  A double `__` [can open strong emphasis] iff\n    it is part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    and either (a) not part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    or (b) part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    preceded by a [Unicode punctuation character].\n\n7.  A double `**` [can close strong emphasis](@)\n    iff it is part of a [right-flanking delimiter run].\n\n8.  A double `__` [can close strong emphasis] iff\n    it is part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    and either (a) not part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    or (b) part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    followed by a [Unicode punctuation character].\n\n"
- "9.  Emphasis begins with a delimiter that [can open emphasis] and ends\n    with a delimiter that [can close emphasis], and that uses the same\n    character (`_` or `*`) as the opening delimiter.  The\n    opening and closing delimiters must belong to separate\n    [delimiter runs].  If one of the delimiters can both\n    open and close emphasis, then the sum of the lengths of the\n    delimiter runs containing the opening and closing delimiters\n    must not be a multiple of 3 unless both lengths are\n    multiples of 3.\n\n10. Strong emphasis begins with a delimiter that\n    [can open strong emphasis] and ends with a delimiter that\n    [can close strong emphasis], and that uses the same character\n    (`_` or `*`) as the opening delimiter.  The\n    opening and closing delimiters must belong to separate\n    [delimiter runs].

- "11. A literal `*` character cannot occur at the beginning or end of\n    `*`-delimited emphasis or `**`-delimited strong emphasis, unless it\n    is backslash-escaped.\n\n12. A literal `_` character cannot occur at the beginning or end of\n    `_`-delimited emphasis or `__`-delimited strong emphasis, unless it\n    is backslash-escaped.\n\nWhere rules 1--12 above are compatible with multiple parsings,\nthe following principles resolve ambiguity:\n"
- "\n13. The number of nestings should be minimized. Thus, for example,\n    an interpretation `<strong>...</strong>` is always preferred to\n    `<em><em>...</em></em>`.\n\n14. An interpretation `<em><strong>...</strong></em>` is always\n    preferred to `<strong><em>...</em></strong>`.\n\n15. When two potential emphasis or strong emphasis spans overlap,\n    so that the second begins before the first ends and ends after\n    the first ends, the first takes precedence. Thus, for example,\n    `*foo _bar* baz_` is parsed as `<em>foo _bar</em> baz_` rather\n    than `*foo <em>bar* baz</em>`.\n\n16. When there are two potential emphasis or strong emphasis spans\n    with the same closing delimiter, the shorter one (the one that\n    opens later) takes precedence. Thus, for example,\n    `**foo **bar baz**` is parsed as `**foo <strong>bar baz</strong>`\n    rather than `<strong>foo **bar baz</strong>`.\n\n"
- "17. Inline code spans, links, images, and HTML tags group more tightly\n    than emphasis.  So, when there is a choice between an interpretation\n    that contains one of these elements and one that does not, the\n    former always wins.  Thus, for example, `*[foo*](bar)` is\n    parsed as `*<a href=\"bar\">foo*</a>` rather than as\n    `<em>[foo</em>](bar)`.\n\nThese rules can be illustrated through a series of examples.\n\nRule 1:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n*foo bar*\n.\n<p><em>foo bar</em></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThis is not emphasis, because the opening `*` is followed by\nwhitespace, and hence not part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\na * foo bar*\n.\n<p>a * foo bar*</p>\n````````````````````````````````"

When an image is rendered to HTML,\nthis is standardly used as the image's `alt` attribute.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n![foo](/url \"title\")\n.\n<p><img src=\"/url\" alt=\"foo\" title=\"title\" /></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n![foo *bar*]\n\n[foo *bar*]: train.jpg \"train & tracks\"\n.\n<p><img src=\"train.jpg\" alt=\"foo bar\" title=\"train &amp; tracks\" /></p>\n````````````````````````````````"

- "# Appendix: A parsing strategy\n\nIn this appendix we describe some features of the parsing strategy\nused in the CommonMark reference implementations.\n\n"
- "## Overview\n\nParsing has two phases:\n\n1. In the first phase, lines of input are consumed and the block\nstructure of the document---its division into paragraphs, block quotes,\nlist items, and so on---is constructed.  Text is assigned to these\nblocks but not parsed. Link reference definitions are parsed and a\nmap of links is constructed.\n\n2. In the second phase, the raw text contents of paragraphs and headings\nare parsed into sequences of Markdown inline elements (strings,\ncode spans, links, emphasis, and so on), using the map of link\nreferences constructed in phase 1.\n\nAt each point in processing, the document is represented as a tree of\n**blocks**.  The root of the tree is a `document` block.  The `document`\nmay have any number of other blocks as **children**.  These children\nmay, in turn, have other blocks as children.  The last child of a block\nis normally considered **open**, meaning that subsequent lines of input\ncan alter its contents.  (Blocks that are not open are **closed**.)\nHere, for example, is a possible document tree, with the open blocks\nmarked by arrows:\n"
- "\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n       paragraph\n         \"Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet.\"\n    -> list (type=bullet tight=true bullet_char=-)\n         list_item\n           paragraph\n             \"Qui *quodsi iracundia*\"\n      -> list_item\n        -> paragraph\n             \"aliquando id\"\n```\n\n"
- "## Phase 1: block structure\n\nEach line that is processed has an effect on this tree.  The line is\nanalyzed and, depending on its contents, the document may be altered\nin one or more of the following ways:\n\n1. One or more open blocks may be closed.\n2. One or more new blocks may be created as children of the\n   last open block.\n3. Text may be added to the last (deepest) open block remaining\n   on the tree.\n\nOnce a line has been incorporated into the tree in this way,\nit can be discarded, so input can be read in a stream.\n\nFor each line, we follow this procedure:\n"
- "\n1. First we iterate through the open blocks, starting with the\nroot document, and descending through last children down to the last\nopen block.  Each block imposes a condition that the line must satisfy\nif the block is to remain open.  For example, a block quote requires a\n`>` character.  A paragraph requires a non-blank line.\nIn this phase we may match all or just some of the open\nblocks.  But we cannot close unmatched blocks yet, because we may have a\n[lazy continuation line].\n\n2.  Next, after consuming the continuation markers for existing\nblocks, we look for new block starts (e.g. `>` for a block quote).\nIf we encounter a new block start, we close any blocks unmatched\nin step 1 before creating the new block as a child of the last\nmatched container block.\n\n3.  Finally, we look at the remainder of the line (after block\nmarkers like `>`, list markers, and indentation have been consumed).\nThis is text that can be incorporated into the last open\nblock (a paragraph, code block, heading, or raw HTML).\n\n"
- "Setext headings are formed when we see a line of a paragraph\nthat is a [setext heading underline].\n\nReference link definitions are detected when a paragraph is closed;\nthe accumulated text lines are parsed to see if they begin with\none or more reference link definitions.  Any remainder becomes a\nnormal paragraph.\n\nWe can see how this works by considering how the tree above is\ngenerated by four lines of Markdown:\n\n``` markdown\n> Lorem ipsum dolor\nsit amet.\n> - Qui *quodsi iracundia*\n> - aliquando id\n```\n\nAt the outset, our document model is just\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n```\n\nThe first line of our text,\n\n``` markdown\n> Lorem ipsum dolor\n```\n\ncauses a `block_quote` block to be created as a child of our\nopen `document` block, and a `paragraph` block as a child of\nthe `block_quote`.  Then the text is added to the last open\nblock, the `paragraph`:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n    -> paragraph\n         \"Lorem ipsum dolor\"\n```\n\nThe next line,\n\n``` markdown\nsit amet.\n```"
- "\n\nis a \"lazy continuation\" of the open `paragraph`, so it gets added\nto the paragraph's text:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n    -> paragraph\n         \"Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet.\"\n```\n\nThe third line,\n\n``` markdown\n> - Qui *quodsi iracundia*\n```\n\ncauses the `paragraph` block to be closed, and a new `list` block\nopened as a child of the `block_quote`.  A `list_item` is also\nadded as a child of the `list`, and a `paragraph` as a child of\nthe `list_item`.  The text is then added to the new `paragraph`:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n       paragraph\n         \"Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet.\"\n    -> list (type=bullet tight=true bullet_char=-)\n      -> list_item\n        -> paragraph\n             \"Qui *quodsi iracundia*\"\n```\n\nThe fourth line,\n\n``` markdown\n> - aliquando id\n```"
- "\n\ncauses the `list_item` (and its child the `paragraph`) to be closed,\nand a new `list_item` opened up as child of the `list`.  A `paragraph`\nis added as a child of the new `list_item`, to contain the text.\nWe thus obtain the final tree:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n       paragraph\n         \"Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet.\"\n    -> list (type=bullet tight=true bullet_char=-)\n         list_item\n           paragraph\n             \"Qui *quodsi iracundia*\"\n      -> list_item\n        -> paragraph\n             \"aliquando id\"\n```\n\n"
- "## Phase 2: inline structure\n\nOnce all of the input has been parsed, all open blocks are closed.\n\nWe then \"walk the tree,\" visiting every node, and parse raw\nstring contents of paragraphs and headings as inlines.  At this\npoint we have seen all the link reference definitions, so we can\nresolve reference links as we go.\n\n``` tree\ndocument\n  block_quote\n    paragraph\n      str \"Lorem ipsum dolor\"\n      softbreak\n      str \"sit amet.\"\n    list (type=bullet tight=true bullet_char=-)\n      list_item\n        paragraph\n          str \"Qui \"\n          emph\n            str \"quodsi iracundia\"\n      list_item\n        paragraph\n          str \"aliquando id\"\n```\n\nNotice how the [line ending] in the first paragraph has\nbeen parsed as a `softbreak`, and the asterisks in the first list item\nhave become an `emph`.\n\n"
- "### An algorithm for parsing nested emphasis and links\n\nBy far the trickiest part of inline parsing is handling emphasis,\nstrong emphasis, links, and images.  This is done using the following\nalgorithm.\n\nWhen we're parsing inlines and we hit either\n\n- a run of `*` or `_` characters, or\n- a `[` or `![`\n\nwe insert a text node with these symbols as its literal content, and we\nadd a pointer to this text node to the [delimiter stack](@).\n\nThe [delimiter stack] is a doubly linked list.  Each\nelement contains a pointer to a text node, plus information about\n\n- the type of delimiter (`[`, `![`, `*`, `_`)\n- the number of delimiters,\n- whether the delimiter is \"active\" (all are active to start), and\n- whether the delimiter is a potential opener, a potential closer,\n  or both (which depends on what sort of characters precede\n  and follow the delimiters).\n\nWhen we hit a `]` character, we call the *look for link or image*\nprocedure (see below).\n"
- "\nWhen we hit the end of the input, we call the *process emphasis*\nprocedure (see below), with `stack_bottom` = NULL.\n\n"
- "#### *look for link or image*\n\nStarting at the top of the delimiter stack, we look backwards\nthrough the stack for an opening `[` or `![` delimiter.\n"
- "\n- If we don't find one, we return a literal text node `]`.\n\n- If we do find one, but it's not *active*, we remove the inactive\n  delimiter from the stack, and return a literal text node `]`.\n\n- If we find one and it's active, then we parse ahead to see if\n  we have an inline link/image, reference link/image, collapsed reference\n  link/image, or shortcut reference link/image.\n\n  + If we don't, then we remove the opening delimiter from the\n    delimiter stack and return a literal text node `]`.\n\n  + If we do, then\n\n    * We return a link or image node whose children are the inlines\n      after the text node pointed to by the opening delimiter.\n\n    * We run *process emphasis* on these inlines, with the `[` opener\n      as `stack_bottom`.\n\n    * We remove the opening delimiter.\n\n    * If we have a link (and not an image), we also set all\n      `[` delimiters before the opening delimiter to *inactive*.  (This\n      will prevent us from getting links within links.)\n\n"
- "#### *process emphasis*\n\nParameter `stack_bottom` sets a lower bound to how far we\ndescend in the [delimiter stack].  If it is NULL, we can\ngo all the way to the bottom.  Otherwise, we stop before\nvisiting `stack_bottom`.\n\nLet `current_position` point to the element on the [delimiter stack]\njust above `stack_bottom` (or the first element if `stack_bottom`\nis NULL).\n\nWe keep track of the `openers_bottom` for each delimiter\ntype (`*`, `_`), indexed to the length of the closing delimiter run\n(modulo 3) and to whether the closing delimiter can also be an\nopener.  Initialize this to `stack_bottom`.\n\nThen we repeat the following until we run out of potential\nclosers:\n"
- "\n- Move `current_position` forward in the delimiter stack (if needed)\n  until we find the first potential closer with delimiter `*` or `_`.\n  (This will be the potential closer closest\n  to the beginning of the input -- the first one in parse order.)\n\n- Now, look back in the stack (staying above `stack_bottom` and\n  the `openers_bottom` for this delimiter type) for the\n  first matching potential opener (\"matching\" means same delimiter).\n\n"
- "- If one is found:\n\n  + Figure out whether we have emphasis or strong emphasis:\n    if both closer and opener spans have length >= 2, we have\n    strong, otherwise regular.\n\n  + Insert an emph or strong emph node accordingly, after\n    the text node corresponding to the opener.\n\n  + Remove any delimiters between the opener and closer from\n    the delimiter stack.\n\n  + Remove 1 (for regular emph) or 2 (for strong emph) delimiters\n    from the opening and closing text nodes.  If they become empty\n    as a result, remove them and remove the corresponding element\n    of the delimiter stack.  If the closing node is removed, reset\n    `current_position` to the next element in the stack.\n\n"
- "- If none is found:\n\n  + Set `openers_bottom` to the element before `current_position`.\n    (We know that there are no openers for this kind of closer up to and\n    including this point, so this puts a lower bound on future searches.)\n\n  + If the closer at `current_position` is not a potential opener,\n    remove it from the delimiter stack (since we know it can't\n    be a closer either).\n\n  + Advance `current_position` to the next element in the stack.\n\nAfter we're done, we remove all delimiters above `stack_bottom` from the\ndelimiter stack.\n"
