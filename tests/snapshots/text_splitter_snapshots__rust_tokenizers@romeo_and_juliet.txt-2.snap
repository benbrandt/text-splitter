- "THE PROLOGUE\n\n Enter Chorus.\n\nCHORUS.\nTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\nFrom forth the fatal loins of these two foes\nA pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;\nWhose misadventur’d piteous overthrows\nDoth with their death bury their parents’ strife.\nThe fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,\nAnd the continuance of their parents’ rage,\nWhich, but their children’s end, nought could remove,\nIs now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;\nThe which, if you with patient ears attend,\nWhat here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n"
- "ACT I\n\nSCENE I. A public place.\n\n Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.\n\nSAMPSON.\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.\n\nGREGORY.\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\n\nSAMPSON.\nI mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.\n\nGREGORY.\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.\n\nSAMPSON.\nI strike quickly, being moved.\n\nGREGORY.\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\n\nSAMPSON.\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\n\nGREGORY.\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou\nart moved, thou runn’st away.\n\nSAMPSON.\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand.\nI will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.\n\nGREGORY.\nThat shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.\n\nSAMPSON.\nTrue, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to\nthe wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and\nthrust his maids to the wall.\n\nGREGORY.\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the\nmen I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.\n\nGREGORY.\nThe heads of the maids?\n\nSAMPSON.\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense\nthou wilt.\n\nGREGORY.\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\n\nSAMPSON.\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a\npretty piece of flesh.\n\nGREGORY.\n’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.\nDraw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.\n\n Enter Abram and Balthasar.\n\nSAMPSON.\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\n\nGREGORY.\nHow? Turn thy back and run?\n\nSAMPSON.\nFear me not.\n\nGREGORY.\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\n\nSAMPSON.\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\n\nGREGORY.\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\n\nSAMPSON.\nNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to\nthem if they bear it.\n\n"
- "ABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON.\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\n\nABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON.\nIs the law of our side if I say ay?\n\nGREGORY.\nNo.\n\nSAMPSON.\nNo sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.\n\nGREGORY.\nDo you quarrel, sir?\n\nABRAM.\nQuarrel, sir? No, sir.\n\nSAMPSON.\nBut if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.\n\nABRAM.\nNo better.\n\nSAMPSON.\nWell, sir.\n\n Enter Benvolio.\n\nGREGORY.\nSay better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.\n\nSAMPSON.\nYes, better, sir.\n\nABRAM.\nYou lie.\n\nSAMPSON.\nDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.\n\n [_They fight._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nPart, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.\n\n [_Beats down their swords._]\n\n Enter Tybalt.\n\nTYBALT.\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\nTurn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nI do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,\nOr manage it to part these men with me.\n\nTYBALT.\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\nHave at thee, coward.\n\n [_They fight._]\n\n Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\nDown with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\n\n Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.\n\nCAPULET.\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\n\nCAPULET.\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\n\n Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.\n\nMONTAGUE.\nThou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.\n\nLADY MONTAGUE.\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\n\n Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—\nWill they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\nThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\nHave thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\nCanker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\nFor this time all the rest depart away:\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\n\n [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\n Citizens and Servants._]\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nHere were the servants of your adversary\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\nI drew to part them, in the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\nWhich, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,\nWho nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part,\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\n\nLADY MONTAGUE.\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\nSo early walking did I see your son.\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\nAnd gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\n\nMONTAGUE.\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\n\nMONTAGUE.\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\n\nMONTAGUE.\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,\nIs to himself—I will not say how true—\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\n\nMONTAGUE.\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\n\n [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nGood morrow, cousin.\n\nROMEO.\nIs the day so young?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBut new struck nine.\n\nROMEO.\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?\n\nROMEO.\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nIn love?\n\nROMEO.\nOut.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nOf love?\n\nROMEO.\nOut of her favour where I am in love.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof.\n\nROMEO.\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\nHere’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\nO anything, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\nDost thou not laugh?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nNo coz, I rather weep.\n\nROMEO.\nGood heart, at what?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAt thy good heart’s oppression.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it prest\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\nBeing purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz.\n\n [_Going._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nSoft! I will go along:\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\n\nROMEO.\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\nThis is not Romeo, he’s some other where.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\n\nROMEO.\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.\n\nROMEO.\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,\nA word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nI aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.\n\nROMEO.\nA right good markman, and she’s fair I love.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\n\nROMEO.\nWell, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit\nWith Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;\nAnd in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,\nFrom love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms\nNor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\nO she’s rich in beauty, only poor\nThat when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\nFor beauty starv’d with her severity,\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\nDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBe rul’d by me, forget to think of her.\n\nROMEO.\nO teach me how I should forget to think.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\nExamine other beauties.\n\nROMEO.\n’Tis the way\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair,\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note\nWhere I may read who pass’d that passing fair?\nFarewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nI’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Street.\n\n Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\n\nPARIS.\nOf honourable reckoning are you both,\nAnd pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.\nBut now my lord, what say you to my suit?\n\nCAPULET.\nBut saying o’er what I have said before.\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world,\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\nLet two more summers wither in their pride\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\n\nPARIS.\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nAnd too soon marr’d are those so early made.\nThe earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\nMy will to her consent is but a part;\nAnd she agree, within her scope of choice\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustom’d feast,\nWhereto I have invited many a guest,\nSuch as I love, and you among the store,\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\nWhen well apparell’d April on the heel\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be:\nWhich, on more view of many, mine, being one,\nMay stand in number, though in reckoning none.\nCome, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about\nThrough fair Verona; find those persons out\n"
- "Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay.\n\n [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]\n\nSERVANT.\nFind them out whose names are written here! It is written that the\nshoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the\nfisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to\nfind those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what\nnames the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good\ntime!\n\n Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nTut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,\nOne pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;\nTurn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\nOne desperate grief cures with another’s languish:\nTake thou some new infection to thy eye,\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\n\nROMEO.\nYour plantain leaf is excellent for that.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nFor what, I pray thee?\n\nROMEO.\nFor your broken shin.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNot mad, but bound more than a madman is:\nShut up in prison, kept without my food,\nWhipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.\n\nSERVANT.\nGod gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\n\nROMEO.\nAy, mine own fortune in my misery.\n\nSERVANT.\nPerhaps you have learned it without book.\nBut I pray, can you read anything you see?\n\nROMEO.\nAy, If I know the letters and the language.\n\nSERVANT.\nYe say honestly, rest you merry!\n\nROMEO.\nStay, fellow; I can read.\n\n [_He reads the letter._]\n\n_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\nCounty Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\nThe lady widow of Utruvio;\nSignior Placentio and his lovely nieces;\nMercutio and his brother Valentine;\nMine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\nMy fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;\nLucio and the lively Helena. _\n\n\n"
- "A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?\n\nSERVANT.\nUp.\n\nROMEO.\nWhither to supper?\n\nSERVANT.\nTo our house.\n\nROMEO.\nWhose house?\n\nSERVANT.\nMy master’s.\n\nROMEO.\nIndeed I should have ask’d you that before.\n\nSERVANT.\nNow I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,\nand if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a\ncup of wine. Rest you merry.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAt this same ancient feast of Capulet’s\nSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;\nWith all the admired beauties of Verona.\nGo thither and with unattainted eye,\nCompare her face with some that I shall show,\nAnd I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\n\nROMEO.\nWhen the devout religion of mine eye\nMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;\nAnd these who, often drown’d, could never die,\nTransparent heretics, be burnt for liars.\nOne fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\nNe’er saw her match since first the world begun.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,\nHerself pois’d with herself in either eye:\nBut in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d\nYour lady’s love against some other maid\nThat I will show you shining at this feast,\nAnd she shall scant show well that now shows best.\n\nROMEO.\nI’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,\nBut to rejoice in splendour of my own.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nNurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.\n\nNURSE.\nNow, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,\nI bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!\nGod forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\nJULIET.\nHow now, who calls?\n\nNURSE.\nYour mother.\n\nJULIET.\nMadam, I am here. What is your will?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThis is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,\nWe must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,\nI have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.\nThou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.\n\nNURSE.\nFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nShe’s not fourteen.\n\nNURSE.\nI’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,\nAnd yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,\nShe is not fourteen. How long is it now\nTo Lammas-tide?\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nA fortnight and odd days.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,\nCome Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\nSusan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—\nWere of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\nShe was too good for me. But as I said,\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\nThat shall she, marry; I remember it well.\n’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\nAnd she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day:\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua:\nNay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\nTo see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!\nShake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,\nTo bid me trudge.\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\n"
- "For even the day before she broke her brow,\nAnd then my husband,—God be with his soul!\nA was a merry man,—took up the child:\n‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,\nThe pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.\nTo see now how a jest shall come about.\nI warrant, and I should live a thousand years,\nI never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,\nTo think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;\nAnd yet I warrant it had upon it brow\nA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;\nA perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\n‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.\n\nJULIET.\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.\n\nNURSE.\nPeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace\nThou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:\nAnd I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nMarry, that marry is the very theme\nI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\nHow stands your disposition to be married?\n\nJULIET.\nIt is an honour that I dream not of.\n\nNURSE.\nAn honour! Were not I thine only nurse,\nI would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, think of marriage now: younger than you,\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\nAre made already mothers. By my count\nI was your mother much upon these years\nThat you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\n\nNURSE.\nA man, young lady! Lady, such a man\nAs all the world—why he’s a man of wax.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nVerona’s summer hath not such a flower.\n\nNURSE.\nNay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhat say you, can you love the gentleman?\nThis night you shall behold him at our feast;\nRead o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,\nAnd find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.\nExamine every married lineament,\nAnd see how one another lends content;\nAnd what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,\nFind written in the margent of his eyes.\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,\nTo beautify him, only lacks a cover:\nThe fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride\nFor fair without the fair within to hide.\nThat book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess,\nBy having him, making yourself no less.\n\nNURSE.\nNo less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?\n\nJULIET.\nI’ll look to like, if looking liking move:\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\n\n Enter a Servant.\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady\nasked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.\nI must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWe follow thee.\n\n [_Exit Servant._]\n\nJuliet, the County stays.\n\nNURSE.\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Street.\n\n Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;\n Torch-bearers and others.\n\nROMEO.\nWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\nOr shall we on without apology?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nThe date is out of such prolixity:\nWe’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,\nBearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,\nScaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;\nNor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\nAfter the prompter, for our entrance:\nBut let them measure us by what they will,\nWe’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.\n\nROMEO.\nGive me a torch, I am not for this ambling;\nBeing but heavy I will bear the light.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\n\nROMEO.\nNot I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,\nWith nimble soles, I have a soul of lead\nSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nYou are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,\nAnd soar with them above a common bound.\n\nROMEO.\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\nTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound,\nI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\nUnder love’s heavy burden do I sink.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\n\nROMEO.\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,\nToo rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\nGive me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]\nA visor for a visor. What care I\nWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?\nHere are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\n\nROMEO.\nA torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\nFor I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,\nI’ll be a candle-holder and look on,\nThe game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nTut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:\nIf thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire\nOr save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest\nUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.\n\nROMEO.\nNay, that’s not so.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nI mean sir, in delay\nWe waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\n\nROMEO.\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\nBut ’tis no wit to go.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWhy, may one ask?\n\nROMEO.\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAnd so did I.\n\nROMEO.\nWell what was yours?\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThat dreamers often lie.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\nOver men’s noses as they lie asleep:\nHer waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\nHer traces, of the smallest spider’s web;\nThe collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;\nHer whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;\nHer waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\nNot half so big as a round little worm\nPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\nTime out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;\nO’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;\nO’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;\nO’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,\n"
- "Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\nSometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,\nTickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,\nThen dreams he of another benefice:\nSometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,\nOf healths five fathom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;\nAnd, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night;\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,\nWhich, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them, and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage:\nThis is she,—\n\nROMEO.\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,\nThou talk’st of nothing.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,\nAnd, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his side to the dew-dropping south.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\n\nROMEO.\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars,\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night’s revels; and expire the term\nOf a despised life, clos’d in my breast\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\nBut he that hath the steerage of my course\nDirect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!\n\nBENVOLIO.\nStrike, drum.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.\n\n Musicians waiting.

She that makes dainty,\nShe I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?\nWelcome, gentlemen!

What of that?\nHer eye discourses, I will answer it.\nI am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand.\nO that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek.\n\nJULIET.\nAy me.\n\n"

- "JULIET.\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.\nFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\nWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment.\nDost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:\nBut trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,\nMy true-love passion; therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\n"

Although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract tonight;\nIt is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say It lightens.

But where hast thou been then?\n\nROMEO.\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\nWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me\nThat’s by me wounded. Both our remedies\nWithin thy help and holy physic lies.\nI bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,\nMy intercession likewise steads my foe.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;\nRiddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\n\nROMEO.\nThen plainly know my heart’s dear love is set\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet.\nAs mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\nAnd all combin’d, save what thou must combine\nBy holy marriage. When, and where, and how\nWe met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,\nI’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\nThat thou consent to marry us today.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHoly Saint Francis! What a change is here!\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\nSo soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\nHath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste.\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\nThy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\nOf an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\nAnd art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,\nWomen may fall, when there’s no strength in men.\n\nROMEO.\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\n\nROMEO.\nAnd bad’st me bury love.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNot in a grave\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\nThe other did not so.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, she knew well\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\nBut come young waverer, come go with me,\nIn one respect I’ll thy assistant be;\nFor this alliance may so happy prove,\nTo turn your households’ rancour to pure love.\n\nROMEO.\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Street.\n\n Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so\nthat he will sure run mad.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s\nhouse.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nA challenge, on my life.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nRomeo will answer it.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAny man that can write may answer a letter.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nNay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAlas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black\neye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart\ncleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter\nTybalt?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\n\nMERCUTIO.\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\ncompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\nand proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\nyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\na gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,\nthe immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nThe what?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners\nof accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\nwhore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should\nbe thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,\nthese pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot\nsit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\nfishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to\nhis lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to\nberhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings\nand harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\nRomeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You\ngave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\n\nROMEO.\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\nmine a man may strain courtesy.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThat’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\nin the hams.\n\nROMEO.\nMeaning, to curtsy.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\n\nROMEO.\nA most courteous exposition.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\n\nROMEO.\nPink for flower.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nRight.\n\nROMEO.\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,\nthat when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\nwearing, solely singular.\n\nROMEO.\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!\n\nMERCUTIO.\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\n\nROMEO.\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast\nmore of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my\nwhole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\n\nROMEO.\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\ngoose.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\n\nROMEO.\nNay, good goose, bite not.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.\n\nROMEO.\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?\n\nMERCUTIO.\nO here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\nell broad.\n\nROMEO.\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves\nthee far and wide a broad goose.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou\nsociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as\nwell as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nStop there, stop there.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\nlonger.\n\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\n\nROMEO.\nHere’s goodly gear!\nA sail, a sail!\n\nMERCUTIO.\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\n\nNURSE.\nPeter!\n\nPETER.\nAnon.\n\nNURSE.\nMy fan, Peter.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\n\nNURSE.\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\n\nNURSE.\nIs it good-den?\n\nMERCUTIO.\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\nprick of noon.\n\nNURSE.\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\n\nROMEO.\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\n\nROMEO.\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\nfault of a worse.\n\nNURSE.\nYou say well.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\n\nNURSE.\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nShe will endite him to some supper.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\n\nROMEO.\nWhat hast thou found?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\n[_Sings._]\n    An old hare hoar,\n    And an old hare hoar,\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\n    But a hare that is hoar\n    Is too much for a score\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\n\nROMEO.\nI will follow you.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\n\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\n\nNURSE.\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\nropery?\n\nROMEO.\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\nuse me at his pleasure!\n\nPETER.\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\nvery weak dealing.\n\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\nthee,—\n\nNURSE.\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\nbe a joyful woman.\n\nROMEO.\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\n\nNURSE.\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\ngentlemanlike offer.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\n\nNURSE.\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\n\nROMEO.\nGo to; I say you shall.\n\nNURSE.\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\n\nROMEO.\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\n\nNURSE.\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\n\nROMEO.\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\n\nNURSE.\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\n\nROMEO.\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\n\nROMEO.\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\n\nNURSE.\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\n\nROMEO.\nCommend me to thy lady.\n\nNURSE.\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\n\n [_Exit Romeo._]\n\nPETER.\nAnon.\n\nNURSE.\nBefore and apace.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\nTherefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\nShe’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me.\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\n\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\n\nO God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\n\nNURSE.\nPeter, stay at the gate.\n\n [_Exit Peter._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNow, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\nIf good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\n\nNURSE.\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!\n\nJULIET.\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\nNay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.\n\nNURSE.\nJesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am\nout of breath?\n\nJULIET.\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\n\nJULIET.\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\n\nNURSE.\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\nMy back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.\n\nJULIET.\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\nSweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\nAnd I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?\n\nJULIET.\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest.\n‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\n‘Where is your mother?’\n\nNURSE.\nO God’s lady dear,\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.\nIs this the poultice for my aching bones?\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\n\nJULIET.\nHere’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?\n\nNURSE.\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?\n\nJULIET.\nI have.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife.\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,\nThey’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.\nHie you to church. I must another way,\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love\nMust climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.\nI am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\nBut you shall bear the burden soon at night.\nGo. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\n\nJULIET.\nHie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\n\nROMEO.\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\nAnd in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\n\nJULIET.\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\n\nJULIET.\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\n\nROMEO.\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n"
- "ACT III\n\nSCENE I. A public Place.\n\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\nAnd if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\na tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no\nneed of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\ndrawer, when indeed there is no need.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAm I like such a fellow?\n\nMERCUTIO.\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as\nsoon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAnd what to?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would\nkill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\ntutor me from quarrelling!\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThe fee simple! O simple!\n\n Enter Tybalt and others.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nBy my heel, I care not.\n\nTYBALT.\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\nword and a blow.\n\nTYBALT.\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\noccasion.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\n\nTYBALT.\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\n\nBENVOLIO.\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\nTYBALT.\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\n\nTYBALT.\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\n\nROMEO.\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\n\nTYBALT.\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\n\nROMEO.\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\n\nTYBALT.\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\n\nTYBALT.\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\n\nROMEO.\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nCome, sir, your passado.\n\n [_They fight._]\n\nROMEO.\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\nHold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\n\n [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]\n\nMERCUTIO.\nI am hurt.\nA plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.\nIs he gone, and hath nothing?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nWhat, art thou hurt?\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.\nWhere is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\n\n [_Exit Page._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\narm.\n\nROMEO.\nI thought all for the best.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\nThey have made worms’ meat of me.\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!\n\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\nHath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,\nThy beauty hath made me effeminate\nAnd in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.\n\n Re-enter Benvolio.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,\nThat gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,\nWhich too untimely here did scorn the earth.\n\nROMEO.\nThis day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;\nThis but begins the woe others must end.\n\n Re-enter Tybalt.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.\n\nROMEO.\nAgain in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\nAway to heaven respective lenity,\nAnd fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!\nNow, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again\nThat late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul\nIs but a little way above our heads,\nStaying for thine to keep him company.\nEither thou or I, or both, must go with him.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nThou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\nShalt with him hence.\n\nROMEO.\nThis shall determine that.\n\n [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nRomeo, away, be gone!\nThe citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\nStand not amaz’d.

- "BENVOLIO.\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;\nRomeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal\nYour high displeasure. All this uttered\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\n"
- "This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\n\nPRINCE.\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\n\nMONTAGUE.\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\nThe life of Tybalt.\n\nPRINCE.\nAnd for that offence\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\nBear hence this body, and attend our will.\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\n\n"

Such a waggoner\nAs Phaeton would whip you to the west\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.\nSpread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\nThat runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo\nLeap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites\nBy their own beauties: or, if love be blind,\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\nThou sober-suited matron, all in black,\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match,\nPlay’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\nHood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,\nWith thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\nCome, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\nWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.\nCome gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,\nGive me my Romeo, and when I shall die,\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\n"

O, here comes my Nurse,\nAnd she brings news, and every tongue that speaks\nBut Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.\n\n Enter Nurse, with cords.\n\nNow, Nurse, what news?

- "JULIET.\nShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\nAh, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,\nWhen I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?\nBut wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\nThat villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.\nBack, foolish tears, back to your native spring,\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,\nWhich you mistaking offer up to joy.\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,\nAnd Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.\nAll this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?\nSome word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,\nThat murder’d me. I would forget it fain,\nBut O, it presses to my memory\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.\nTybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.\nThat ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there.\nOr if sour woe delights in fellowship,\nAnd needly will be rank’d with other griefs,\nWhy follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,\n"
- "Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,\nWhich modern lamentation might have mov’d?\nBut with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,\n‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\nAll slain, all dead.

- "ROMEO.\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\nMuch more than death. Do not say banishment.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\n\nROMEO.\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\nHence banished is banish’d from the world,\nAnd world’s exile is death. Then banished\nIs death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\nThou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\nThy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\nTaking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,\nAnd turn’d that black word death to banishment.\nThis is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished.\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly.\nThey are free men but I am banished.\nAnd say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\nHowlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\nTo mangle me with that word banished?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\n\n"

- "ROMEO.\nNurse.\n\nNURSE.\nAh sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.\n\nROMEO.\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\nDoth not she think me an old murderer,\nNow I have stain’d the childhood of our joy\nWith blood remov’d but little from her own?\nWhere is she? And how doth she? And what says\nMy conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?\n\nNURSE.\nO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\nAnd Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again.\n\nROMEO.\nAs if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\nDid murder her, as that name’s cursed hand\nMurder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,\nIn what vile part of this anatomy\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\nThe hateful mansion.\n\n [_Drawing his sword._]\n\n"

By my holy order,\nI thought thy disposition better temper’d.\nHast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\nAnd slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\nWhy rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?\nSince birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet\nIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\nFie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\nWhich, like a usurer, abound’st in all,\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax,\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\nKilling that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;\n"
- "Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\nLike powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\nAnd thou dismember’d with thine own defence.\nWhat, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\nBut thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.\nThe law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,\nAnd turns it to exile; there art thou happy.\nA pack of blessings light upon thy back;\nHappiness courts thee in her best array;\nBut like a misshaped and sullen wench,\nThou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\nGo, get thee to thy love as was decreed,\nAscend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\nBut look thou stay not till the watch be set,\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua;\nWhere thou shalt live till we can find a time\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\nBeg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy\n"

- "CAPULET.\nHang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!\nI tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,\nOr never after look me in the face.\nSpeak not, reply not, do not answer me.\nMy fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\nThat God had lent us but this only child;\nBut now I see this one is one too much,\nAnd that we have a curse in having her.\nOut on her, hilding.\n\nNURSE.\nGod in heaven bless her.\nYou are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\n\nCAPULET.\nAnd why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,\nGood prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.\n\nNURSE.\nI speak no treason.\n\nCAPULET.\nO God ye good-en!\n\nNURSE.\nMay not one speak?\n\nCAPULET.\nPeace, you mumbling fool!\nUtter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,\nFor here we need it not.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nYou are too hot.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nGod’s bread, it makes me mad!\nDay, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,\nAlone, in company, still my care hath been\nTo have her match’d, and having now provided\nA gentleman of noble parentage,\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,\nStuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,\nProportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,\nAnd then to have a wretched puling fool,\nA whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,\nTo answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,\nI am too young, I pray you pardon me.’\nBut, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me.\nLook to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.\nAnd you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;\nAnd you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\nFor by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,\nNor what is mine shall never do thee good.\n"

The time is very short.\n\nPARIS.\nMy father Capulet will have it so;\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nYou say you do not know the lady’s mind.\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\n\nPARIS.\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk’d of love;\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway;\nAnd in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\nMay be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\n[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\nPARIS.\nHappily met, my lady and my wife!\n\nJULIET.\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\n\nPARIS.\nThat may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.\n\n"

- "JULIET.\nTell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\nIf in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise,\nAnd with this knife I’ll help it presently.\nGod join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,\nShall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,\nGive me some present counsel, or behold\n’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die,\nIf what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop’st with death himself to scape from it.\nAnd if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.\n\nJULIET.\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;\nOr hide me nightly in a charnel-house,\nO’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave,\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud;\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt,\nTo live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold then. Go home, be merry, give consent\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;\nTomorrow night look that thou lie alone,\nLet not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\nTake thou this vial, being then in bed,\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off,\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\nShall keep his native progress, but surcease.\nNo warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,\nThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\nTo paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,\nLike death when he shuts up the day of life.\nEach part depriv’d of supple government,\nShall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.\nAnd in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death\nThou shalt continue two and forty hours,\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\nNow when the bridegroom in the morning comes\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\nThen as the manner of our country is,\nIn thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,\nThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\n"
- "In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift,\nAnd hither shall he come, and he and I\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night\nShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,\nIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\nAbate thy valour in the acting it.\n\nJULIET.\nGive me, give me! O tell not me of fear!\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous\nIn this resolve.

Where have you been gadding?\n\nJULIET.\nWhere I have learnt me to repent the sin\nOf disobedient opposition\nTo you and your behests; and am enjoin’d\nBy holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,\nTo beg your pardon.

Stand up.\nThis is as’t should be. Let me see the County.\nAy, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.\nNow afore God, this reverend holy Friar,\nAll our whole city is much bound to him.\n\nJULIET.\nNurse, will you go with me into my closet,\nTo help me sort such needful ornaments\nAs you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nNo, not till Thursday.

There’s a fearful point!\nShall I not then be stifled in the vault,\nTo whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\nAnd there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\nOr, if I live, is it not very like,\nThe horrible conceit of death and night,\nTogether with the terror of the place,\nAs in a vault, an ancient receptacle,\nWhere for this many hundred years the bones\nOf all my buried ancestors are pack’d,\nWhere bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\nLies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,\nAt some hours in the night spirits resort—\nAlack, alack, is it not like that I,\nSo early waking, what with loathsome smells,\n"

O mischief thou art swift\nTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men.\nI do remember an apothecary,—\nAnd hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted\nIn tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,\nCulling of simples, meagre were his looks,\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\nAn alligator stuff’d, and other skins\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\nWere thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,\nAnd if a man did need a poison now,\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\nBeing holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.\n"
- "What, ho! Apothecary!\n\n Enter Apothecary.\n\nAPOTHECARY.\nWho calls so loud?\n\nROMEO.\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins,\nThat the life-weary taker may fall dead,\nAnd that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath\nAs violently as hasty powder fir’d\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.\n\nAPOTHECARY.\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law\nIs death to any he that utters them.\n\nROMEO.\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\nAnd fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\nNeed and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;\nThen be not poor, but break it and take this.\n\nAPOTHECARY.\nMy poverty, but not my will consents.\n\nROMEO.\nI pay thy poverty, and not thy will.\n\n"
- "APOTHECARY.\nPut this in any liquid thing you will\nAnd drink it off; and, if you had the strength\nOf twenty men, it would despatch you straight.\n\nROMEO.\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,\nDoing more murder in this loathsome world\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\nI sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.\nFarewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\nTo Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\n\n Enter Friar John.\n\nFRIAR JOHN.\nHoly Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThis same should be the voice of Friar John.\nWelcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\nOr, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\n\n"
- "FRIAR JOHN.\nGoing to find a barefoot brother out,\nOne of our order, to associate me,\nHere in this city visiting the sick,\nAnd finding him, the searchers of the town,\nSuspecting that we both were in a house\nWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,\nSeal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,\nSo that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWho bare my letter then to Romeo?\n\nFRIAR JOHN.\nI could not send it,—here it is again,—\nNor get a messenger to bring it thee,\nSo fearful were they of infection.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nUnhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\nThe letter was not nice, but full of charge,\nOf dear import, and the neglecting it\nMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence,\nGet me an iron crow and bring it straight\nUnto my cell.\n\nFRIAR JOHN.\nBrother, I’ll go and bring it thee.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNow must I to the monument alone.\nWithin this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\nShe will beshrew me much that Romeo\nHath had no notice of these accidents;\nBut I will write again to Mantua,\nAnd keep her at my cell till Romeo come.\nPoor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.\n\n Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.\n\nPARIS.\nGive me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.\nYet put it out, for I would not be seen.\nUnder yond yew tree lay thee all along,\nHolding thy ear close to the hollow ground;\nSo shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,\nBeing loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,\nBut thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,\nAs signal that thou hear’st something approach.\nGive me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.\n\nPAGE.\n[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone\nHere in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.\n\n [_Retires._]\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.\nO woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,\nWhich with sweet water nightly I will dew,\nOr wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.\nThe obsequies that I for thee will keep,\nNightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.\n\n [_The Page whistles._]\n\nThe boy gives warning something doth approach.\nWhat cursed foot wanders this way tonight,\nTo cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?\nWhat, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.\n\n [_Retires._]\n\n Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\nHold, take this letter; early in the morning\nSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.\nGive me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,\nWhate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof\nAnd do not interrupt me in my course.\nWhy I descend into this bed of death\nIs partly to behold my lady’s face,\nBut chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\nA precious ring, a ring that I must use\nIn dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry\nIn what I further shall intend to do,\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\n\nROMEO.\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\nLive, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nFor all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.\n\n [_Retires_]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\nGorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\n\n [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]\n\nAnd in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.\n\nPARIS.\nThis is that banish’d haughty Montague\nThat murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,\nIt is supposed, the fair creature died,—\nAnd here is come to do some villanous shame\nTo the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\n\n [_Advances._]\n\nStop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.\nCan vengeance be pursu’d further than death?\nCondemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\nObey, and go with me, for thou must die.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\nGood gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.\nFly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\nPut not another sin upon my head\nBy urging me to fury. O be gone.\nBy heaven I love thee better than myself;\nFor I come hither arm’d against myself.\nStay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,\nA madman’s mercy bid thee run away.\n\nPARIS.\nI do defy thy conjuration,\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.\n\nROMEO.\nWilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\n\n [_They fight._]\n\nPAGE.\nO lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nPARIS.\nO, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,\nOpen the tomb, lay me with Juliet.\n\n [_Dies._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIn faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\nMercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!\nWhat said my man, when my betossed soul\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.\nI’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\nA grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.\n\n [_Laying Paris in the monument._]\n\n"
- "How oft when men are at the point of death\nHave they been merry! Which their keepers call\nA lightning before death. O, how may I\nCall this a lightning? O my love, my wife,\nDeath that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\nThou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\nAnd death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee,\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\nWill I set up my everlasting rest;\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\n"
- "From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\nHere’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\n\n [_Dies._]\n\n Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a\n lantern, crow, and spade.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSaint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?\nWho is it that consorts, so late, the dead?\n\nBALTHASAR.\nHere’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,\nWhat torch is yond that vainly lends his light\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\nIt burneth in the Capels’ monument.\n\n"
- "BALTHASAR.\nIt doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,\nOne that you love.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWho is it?\n\nBALTHASAR.\nRomeo.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHow long hath he been there?\n\nBALTHASAR.\nFull half an hour.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGo with me to the vault.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nI dare not, sir;\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nStay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\nO, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nAs I did sleep under this yew tree here,\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\nAnd that my master slew him.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo! [_Advances._]\nAlack, alack, what blood is this which stains\nThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords\nTo lie discolour’d by this place of peace?\n\n [_Enters the monument._]\n\n"
- "Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\nAnd steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour\nIs guilty of this lamentable chance?\nThe lady stirs.\n\n [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]\n\nJULIET.\nO comfortable Friar, where is my lord?\nI do remember well where I should be,\nAnd there I am. Where is my Romeo?\n\n [_Noise within._]\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\nOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\nA greater power than we can contradict\nHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\nAnd Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.\nStay not to question, for the watch is coming.\nCome, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\n\nJULIET.\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.\n\n [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]\n\n"
- "What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?\nPoison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\nO churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop\nTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\nHaply some poison yet doth hang on them,\nTo make me die with a restorative.\n\n [_Kisses him._]\n\nThy lips are warm!\n\nFIRST WATCH.\n[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?\n\nJULIET.\nYea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.\n\n [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]\n\nThis is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.\n\n [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]\n\n Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.\n\nPAGE.\nThis is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nThe ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.\nGo, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.\n\n [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]\n\n"
- "Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\nWho here hath lain this two days buried.\nGo tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.\nRaise up the Montagues, some others search.\n\n [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]\n\nWe see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes\nWe cannot without circumstance descry.\n\n Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nHere’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nHold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\n\n Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.\n\nTHIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\nWe took this mattock and this spade from him\nAs he was coming from this churchyard side.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nA great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.\n\n Enter the Prince and Attendants.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat misadventure is so early up,\nThat calls our person from our morning’s rest?\n\n Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.\n\nCAPULET.\nWhat should it be that they so shriek abroad?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO the people in the street cry Romeo,\nSome Juliet, and some Paris, and all run\nWith open outcry toward our monument.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,\nAnd Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,\nWarm and new kill’d.\n\nPRINCE.\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nHere is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\nThese dead men’s tombs.\n\nCAPULET.\nO heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\nThis dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nO me! This sight of death is as a bell\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\n\n Enter Montague and others.\n\nPRINCE.\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up,\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\nGrief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\n\nPRINCE.\nLook, and thou shalt see.\n\nMONTAGUE.\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\n\nPRINCE.\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities,\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent,\nAnd then will I be general of your woes,\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\nMyself condemned and myself excus’d.\n\nPRINCE.\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\nI married them; and their stol’n marriage day\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\nBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\n"
- "Return’d my letter back. Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\n\nPRINCE.\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\n\n"
- "BALTHASAR.\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\n\nPRINCE.\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\n\nPAGE.\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\n\nCAPULET.\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\n\nMONTAGUE.\nBut I can give thee more,\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\n\nCAPULET.\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\nFor never was a story of more woe\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\n"

- "The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.

We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\n\n"
- "Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"
