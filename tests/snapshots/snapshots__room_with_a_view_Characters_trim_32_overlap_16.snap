- "which here are north rooms,"
- "are north rooms, looking into a"
- ", looking into a courtyard, and"
- "a courtyard, and a long way"
- ", and a long way apart."
- "Oh, Lucy!”"
- "“And a Cockney, besides!”"
- "said Lucy, who had been further"
- had been further saddened by the
- saddened by the Signora’s
- by the Signora’s unexpected
- unexpected accent.
- “It might be London.”
- She looked at the two rows of
- the two rows of English people
- English people who were sitting
- who were sitting at the table;
- at the table; at the row of
- ; at the row of white bottles of
- white bottles of water and red

- bottles of wine that ran between

- the late Poet Laureate that hung
- that hung behind the English
- "the English people, heavily"
- "people, heavily framed; at the"
- framed; at the notice of the
- notice of the English church (
- English church (Rev.
- "Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.),"
- that was the only other
- the only other decoration of the
- of the wall.
- "“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too,"
- "you feel, too, that we might be"
- that we might be in London?
- I can hardly believe that all
- believe that all kinds of other
- kinds of other things are just
- things are just outside.
- I suppose it is one’s being so
- one’s being so tired.”
- “This meat has surely been used
- "surely been used for soup,” said"
- "for soup,” said Miss Bartlett,"
- "Miss Bartlett, laying down her"
- laying down her fork.
- “I want so to see the Arno.
- The rooms the Signora promised
- Signora promised us in her
- us in her letter would have
- would have looked over the Arno.
- The Signora had no business to
- no business to do it at all.
- "Oh, it is a shame!”"
- "“Any nook does for me,” Miss"
- "for me,” Miss Bartlett continued"
- continued; “but it does seem
- but it does seem hard that you
- hard that you shouldn’t have a
- shouldn’t have a view.”
- Lucy felt that she had been
- she had been selfish.
- "“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me"
- "mustn’t spoil me:"
- "of course, you must look over"
- "must look over the Arno, too."
- I meant that.
- The first vacant room in the
- room in the front—” “You must
- "—” “You must have it,” said Miss"
- "it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of"
- ", part of whose travelling"
- whose travelling expenses were
- expenses were paid by Lucy’s
- paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of
- —a piece of generosity to which
- to which she made many a tactful
- many a tactful allusion.
- "“No, no. You must have it.”"
- “I insist on it.
- Your mother would never forgive
- "never forgive me, Lucy.”"
- “She would never forgive _me_.”
- The ladies’ voices grew animated
- "grew animated, and—if the sad"
- ", and—if the sad truth be owned—"
- truth be owned—a little peevish.
- "They were tired, and under the"
- ", and under the guise of"
- the guise of unselfishness they
- they wrangled.
- Some of their neighbours
- their neighbours interchanged
- "interchanged glances, and one of"
- ", and one of them—one of the ill"
- —one of the ill-bred people whom
- bred people whom one does meet
- one does meet abroad—leant
- abroad—leant forward over the
- forward over the table and
- the table and actually intruded
- intruded into their argument.
- "He said:"
- "“I have a view, I have a view.”"
- Miss Bartlett was startled.
- Generally at a pension people
- a pension people looked them
- looked them over for a day or
- for a day or two before speaking
- "before speaking, and often did"
- ", and often did not find out"
- did not find out that they would
- that they would “do” till they
- “do” till they had gone.
- She knew that the intruder was
- "the intruder was ill-bred, even"
- "ill-bred, even before she"
- even before she glanced at him.
- "He was an old man, of heavy"
- "man, of heavy build, with a fair"
- ", with a fair, shaven face and"
- shaven face and large eyes.
- There was something childish in
- "childish in those eyes, though"
- "eyes, though it was not the"
- it was not the childishness of
- childishness of senility.
- What exactly it was Miss
- it was Miss Bartlett did not
- Bartlett did not stop to
- "did not stop to consider, for"
- "to consider, for her glance"
- ", for her glance passed on to"
- passed on to his clothes.
- These did not attract her.
- He was probably trying to become
- trying to become acquainted with
- acquainted with them before they
- them before they got into the
- got into the swim.
- So she assumed a dazed
- assumed a dazed expression when
- "expression when he spoke to her,"
- "he spoke to her, and then said:"
- ", and then said: “A view?"
- "Oh, a view!"
- How delightful a view is!”
- "“This is my son,” said the old"
- ",” said the old man; “his name’s"
- man; “his name’s George.
- He has a view too.”
- "“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett,"
- "Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy,"
- "repressing Lucy, who was about"
- ", who was about to speak."
- "“What I mean,” he continued, “is"
- "continued, “is that you can have"
- "you can have our rooms, and"
- "our rooms, and we’ll have yours."
- We’ll change.”
- The better class of tourist was
- "of tourist was shocked at this,"
- "shocked at this, and sympathized"
- and sympathized with the new-
- with the new-comers.
- "Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened"
- "in reply, opened her mouth as"
- "her mouth as little as possible,"
- "as possible, and said “Thank you"
- said “Thank you very much indeed
- very much indeed; that is out of
- ; that is out of the question.”
- “Why?”
- "said the old man, with both"
- "man, with both fists on the"
- fists on the table.
- “Because it is quite out of the
- "quite out of the question, thank"
- "question, thank you.”"
- "“You see, we don’t like to take—"
- like to take—” began Lucy.
- Her cousin again repressed her.
- “But why?” he persisted.
- “Women like looking at a view;
- at a view; men don’t.”
- And he thumped with his fists
- with his fists like a naughty
- "like a naughty child, and turned"
- ", and turned to his son,"
- "saying, “George, persuade them!”"
- “It’s so obvious they should
- "they should have the rooms,”"
- "have the rooms,” said the son."
- “There’s nothing else to say.”
- He did not look at the ladies as
- "at the ladies as he spoke, but"
- "as he spoke, but his voice was"
- his voice was perplexed and
- perplexed and sorrowful.
- "Lucy, too, was perplexed; but"
- perplexed; but she saw that they
- saw that they were in for what
- were in for what is known as “
- "is known as “quite a scene,” and"
- "a scene,” and she had an odd"
- she had an odd feeling that
- odd feeling that whenever these
- whenever these ill-bred tourists
- "-bred tourists spoke the contest"
- the contest widened and deepened
- "and deepened till it dealt, not"
- "it dealt, not with rooms and"
- "with rooms and views, but with—"
- "views, but with—well, with"
- "with—well, with something quite"
- "something quite different, whose"
- "different, whose existence she"
- existence she had not realized
- had not realized before.
- Now the old man attacked Miss
- attacked Miss Bartlett almost
- "Bartlett almost violently: Why"
- "violently: Why should she not"
- should she not change?
- What possible objection had she?
- They would clear out in half an
- out in half an hour.
- "Miss Bartlett, though skilled in"
- skilled in the delicacies of
- "delicacies of conversation, was"
- ", was powerless in the presence"
- in the presence of brutality.
- It was impossible to snub any
- to snub any one so gross.
- Her face reddened with
- reddened with displeasure.
- She looked around as much as to
- "as much as to say, “Are you all"
- ", “Are you all like this?”"
- "And two little old ladies, who"
- "old ladies, who were sitting"
- who were sitting further up the
- "further up the table, with"
- "the table, with shawls hanging"
- shawls hanging over the backs of
- "the backs of the chairs, looked"

- ", stout but attractive, who"
- "attractive, who hurried forward"

- "once rose to her feet,"
- "to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh"

- "“Not at all,” he answered; “I"
- he answered; “I never suggested

- "“But ought I not to apologize,"
- "to apologize, at all events, for"

- "She tried to locate it, but as"

- Miss Bartlett sedulously denied
- "denied disapproving of any one,"
- "of any one, and added “I am"
- and added “I am afraid you are
- afraid you are finding me a very

- "And the girl again thought: “I"

- "“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor"

- “We dread going to bed.”
- "“Ah, then you look into the"

- “I think he was meaning to be

- "“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss"

- No one was careful with her at

- She proceeded no further into
- "no further into things, for Mr."
- "Beebe reappeared, looking"
- ", looking extremely pleasant."
- "“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s"
- "he cried, “it’s all right about"

- I’m so glad. Mr.

- He has let me come and ask you.
- He would be so pleased.”
- "“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to"
- ",” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we"
- "her cousin, “we must have the"

- The old man is just as nice and
- just as nice and kind as he can

- Miss Bartlett was silent.
- "“I fear,” said Mr."
- "Beebe, after a pause, “that I"

- Not till then did Miss Bartlett
- "Miss Bartlett reply: “My own"

- If you wish me to turn these

- "Would you then,"
- "Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr."
- Emerson that I accept his kind
- "accept his kind offer, and then"
- "offer, and then conduct him to"
- "conduct him to me, in order that"
- ", in order that I may thank him"
- I may thank him personally?”
- She raised her voice as she
- her voice as she spoke; it was
- spoke; it was heard all over the
- "all over the drawing-room, and"
- "-room, and silenced the Guelfs"
- the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
- "The clergyman, inwardly cursing"
- "inwardly cursing the female sex,"
- "the female sex, bowed, and"

- "“Remember, Lucy, I alone am"
- "Lucy, I alone am implicated in"

- I do not wish the acceptance to

- "Grant me that, at all events.”"
- Mr.
- "Beebe was back, saying rather"
- ", saying rather nervously:"
- “Mr.
- "Emerson is engaged, but here is"
- ", but here is his son instead.”"
- The young man gazed down on the
- "down on the three ladies, who"
- "ladies, who felt seated on the"
- "seated on the floor, so low were"
- ", so low were their chairs."
- "“My father,” he said, “is in his"
- "said, “is in his bath, so you"
- "his bath, so you cannot thank"
- you cannot thank him personally.
- But any message given by you to
- given by you to me will be given
- me will be given by me to him as
- by me to him as soon as he comes

- Miss Bartlett was unequal to the
- unequal to the bath.
- All her barbed civilities came
- civilities came forth wrong end

- Emerson scored a notable triumph

- to the delight of Mr.
- Beebe and to the secret delight

- “Poor young man!”
- "said Miss Bartlett, as soon as"
- ", as soon as he had gone."
- “How angry he is with his father
- with his father about the rooms!
- It is all he can do to keep
- can do to keep polite.”
- “In half an hour or so your
- hour or so your rooms will be
- "rooms will be ready,” said Mr."
- Beebe.
- Then looking rather thoughtfully
- "thoughtfully at the two cousins,"
- "the two cousins, he retired to"
- ", he retired to his own rooms,"
- "his own rooms, to write up his"
- to write up his philosophic

- "“Oh, dear!”"
- "breathed the little old lady,"

- “Gentlemen sometimes do not

- "realize—” Her voice faded away,"
- "faded away, but Miss Bartlett"
- Miss Bartlett seemed to

- understand and a conversation
- "a conversation developed, in"

- "Lucy, not realizing either, was"
- "either, was reduced to"

- Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to
- "Handbook to Northern Italy,"
- she committed to memory the most
- memory the most important dates
- important dates of Florentine
- of Florentine History.
- For she was determined to enjoy
- to enjoy herself on the morrow.
- Thus the half-hour crept
- "half-hour crept profitably away,"
- "profitably away, and at last"
- ", and at last Miss Bartlett rose"
- "Bartlett rose with a sigh, and"
- "with a sigh, and said:"
- “I think one might venture now.
- "No, Lucy, do not stir."
- I will superintend the move.”
- "“How you do do everything,” said"
- ",” said Lucy."
- "“Naturally, dear."
- It is my affair.”
- “But I would like to help you.”
- "“No, dear.”"
- Charlotte’s energy!
- And her unselfishness!
- "She had been thus all her life,"
- "all her life, but really, on"
- ", but really, on this Italian"
- "on this Italian tour, she was"

- "So Lucy felt, or strove to feel."
- And yet—there was a rebellious

- spirit in her which wondered
- which wondered whether the
- whether the acceptance might not
- might not have been less
- have been less delicate and more
- and more beautiful.
- "At all events, she entered her"
- she entered her own room without

- any feeling of joy.
- "“I want to explain,” said Miss"
- ",” said Miss Bartlett, “why it"
- ", “why it is that I have taken"
- I have taken the largest room.
- "Naturally, of course, I should"
- "course, I should have given it"

- but I happen to know that it

- Lucy was bewildered.
- “If you are to accept a favour

- "I am a woman of the world, in my"
- "the world, in my small way, and"
- "small way, and I know where"
- and I know where things lead to.
- "However, Mr."
- Beebe is a guarantee of a sort

- "“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,”"

- "Miss Bartlett only sighed, and"

- "Gladstone, until he was so"
- until he was so dreadful about
- dreadful about Ireland.”
- "“I see, I see."
- And now you have gone over to
- gone over to the enemy.”
- "“Oh, please—!"
- "If my father was alive, I am"
- "was alive, I am sure he would"
- am sure he would vote Radical
- vote Radical again now that
- again now that Ireland is all
- Ireland is all right.
- "And as it is, the glass over our"
- glass over our front door was
- front door was broken last
- "was broken last election, and"
- "election, and Freddy is sure it"
- is sure it was the Tories; but
- the Tories; but mother says
- "but mother says nonsense, a"
- "says nonsense, a tramp.”"
- “Shameful!
- "A manufacturing district, I"
- "district, I suppose?”"
- “No—in the Surrey hills.
- "About five miles from Dorking,"
- "from Dorking, looking over the"
- looking over the Weald.”
- "Miss Lavish seemed interested,"
- "interested, and slackened her"
- slackened her trot.
- “What a delightful part; I know
- part; I know it so well.
- It is full of the very nicest
- the very nicest people.
- Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a
- Harry Otway—a Radical if ever
- Radical if ever there was?”
- “Very well indeed.”
- “And old Mrs.
- Butterworth the philanthropist?”
- "“Why, she rents a field of us!"
- How funny!”
- Miss Lavish looked at the narrow
- "at the narrow ribbon of sky, and"
- "of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you"
- ": “Oh, you have property in"
- have property in Surrey?”
- "“Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful"
- "Lucy, fearful of being thought a"
- being thought a snob.
- “Only thirty acres—just the
- "acres—just the garden, all"
- "the garden, all downhill, and"
- "downhill, and some fields.”"
- "Miss Lavish was not disgusted,"
- "not disgusted, and said it was"
- and said it was just the size of
- just the size of her aunt’s
- of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
- Italy receded.
- They tried to remember the last
- the last name of Lady Louisa
- "of Lady Louisa someone, who had"
- "someone, who had taken a house"
- taken a house near Summer Street
- "Summer Street the other year,"
- "the other year, but she had not"
- "but she had not liked it, which"
- "liked it, which was odd of her."
- And just as Miss Lavish had got
- "Lavish had got the name, she"
- "the name, she broke off and"
- "broke off and exclaimed:"
- “Bless us! Bless us and save us!
- We’ve lost the way.”
- Certainly they had seemed a long
- seemed a long time in reaching
- "time in reaching Santa Croce,"
- "Santa Croce, the tower of which"
- tower of which had been plainly
- had been plainly visible from
- visible from the landing window.
- But Miss Lavish had said so much
- had said so much about knowing
- about knowing her Florence by
- "her Florence by heart, that Lucy"
- "heart, that Lucy had followed"
- had followed her with no
- her with no misgivings.
- “Lost! lost!
- "My dear Miss Lucy, during our"
- "Lucy, during our political"
- our political diatribes we have
- we have taken a wrong turning.
- How those horrid Conservatives
- Conservatives would jeer at us!
- What are we to do?
- Two lone females in an unknown
- in an unknown town.
- "Now, this is what _I_ call an"
- what _I_ call an adventure.”
- "Lucy, who wanted to see Santa"
- "to see Santa Croce, suggested,"
- ", suggested, as a possible"
- ", as a possible solution,"
- that they should ask the way
- ask the way there.
- "“Oh, but that is the word of a"
- is the word of a craven!
- "And no, you are not, not, _not_"
- "not, not, _not_ to look at your"
- to look at your Baedeker.
- Give it to me; I shan’t let you
- I shan’t let you carry it.
- We will simply drift.”
- Accordingly they drifted through
- drifted through a series of
- a series of those grey-brown
- "those grey-brown streets,"
- neither commodious nor
- "commodious nor picturesque, in"
- "picturesque, in which the"
- ", in which the eastern quarter"
- eastern quarter of the city
- of the city abounds.
- Lucy soon lost interest in the
- interest in the discontent of
- "discontent of Lady Louisa,"
- and became discontented herself.
- For one ravishing moment Italy
- moment Italy appeared.
- She stood in the Square of the
- Square of the Annunziata and saw
- and saw in the living terra-
- living terra-cotta those divine
- those divine babies whom no
- babies whom no cheap
- whom no cheap reproduction can
- reproduction can ever stale.
- "There they stood, with their"
- ", with their shining limbs"
- shining limbs bursting from the
- "from the garments of charity,"
- "of charity, and their strong"
- and their strong white arms
- white arms extended against
- extended against circlets of
- circlets of heaven.
- Lucy thought she had never seen
- had never seen anything more
- anything more beautiful; but
- "beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with"
- "Lavish, with a shriek of dismay,"
- "of dismay, dragged her forward,"
- "her forward, declaring that they"
- that they were out of their path
- of their path now by at least a
- by at least a mile.
- The hour was approaching at
- approaching at which the
- at which the continental
- the continental breakfast begins
- "breakfast begins, or rather"
- ", or rather ceases, to tell, and"
- ", to tell, and the ladies bought"
- ladies bought some hot chestnut
- hot chestnut paste out of a
- "paste out of a little shop,"
- "a little shop, because it looked"
- it looked so typical.
- It tasted partly of the paper in
- of the paper in which it was
- "in which it was wrapped, partly"
- "wrapped, partly of hair oil,"
- "of hair oil, partly of the great"
- of the great unknown.
- But it gave them strength to
- them strength to drift into
- "to drift into another Piazza,"
- "large and dusty, on the farther"
- ", on the farther side of which"
- side of which rose a black-and-
- a black-and-white façade of
- "-white façade of surpassing"
- of surpassing ugliness.
- Miss Lavish spoke to it
- spoke to it dramatically.
- It was Santa Croce.
- The adventure was over.
- “Stop a minute; let those two
- "; let those two people go on, or"
- "people go on, or I shall have to"
- I shall have to speak to them.
- I do detest conventional
- conventional intercourse. Nasty!
- "they are going into the church,"
- "into the church, too."
- "Oh, the Britisher abroad!”"
- “We sat opposite them at dinner
- them at dinner last night.
- They have given us their rooms.
- They were so very kind.”
- “Look at their figures!”
- laughed Miss Lavish.
- “They walk through my Italy like
- my Italy like a pair of cows.
- "It’s very naughty of me, but I"
- "of me, but I would like to set"
- like to set an examination paper
- "paper at Dover, and turn back"
- ", and turn back every tourist"
- every tourist who couldn’t pass
- couldn’t pass it.”
- “What would you ask us?”
- Miss Lavish laid her hand
- laid her hand pleasantly on
- "pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if"
- "arm, as if to suggest that she,"
- "that she, at all events, would"
- "events, would get full marks."
- In this exalted mood they
- mood they reached the steps of
- "the steps of the great church,"
- "great church, and were about to"
- were about to enter it when Miss
- "it when Miss Lavish stopped,"
- "Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung"
- "squeaked, flung up her arms, and"
- "up her arms, and cried:"
- “There goes my local-colour box!
- I must have a word with him!”
- And in a moment she was away
- "she was away over the Piazza,"
- "over the Piazza, her military"
- ", her military cloak flapping in"
- flapping in the wind; nor did
- wind; nor did she slacken speed
- slacken speed till she caught up
- she caught up an old man with
- "an old man with white whiskers,"
- "white whiskers, and nipped him"
- ", and nipped him playfully upon"
- playfully upon the arm.
- Lucy waited for nearly ten
- for nearly ten minutes.
- Then she began to get tired.
- "The beggars worried her, the"
- "worried her, the dust blew in"
- "the dust blew in her eyes, and"
- "in her eyes, and she remembered"
- she remembered that a young girl
- a young girl ought not to loiter
- not to loiter in public places.
- She descended slowly into the
- slowly into the Piazza with the
- Piazza with the intention of
- the intention of rejoining Miss
- "rejoining Miss Lavish, who was"
- "Lavish, who was really almost"
- really almost too original.
- But at that moment Miss Lavish
- Miss Lavish and her local-colour
- "her local-colour box moved also,"
- "box moved also, and disappeared"
- and disappeared down a side
- "down a side street, both"
- "street, both gesticulating"
- gesticulating largely.
- Tears of indignation came to
- came to Lucy’s eyes partly
- eyes partly because Miss Lavish
- "Miss Lavish had jilted her,"
- "had jilted her, partly because"
- ", partly because she had taken"
- she had taken her Baedeker.
- How could she find her way home?
- How could she find her way about
- her way about in Santa Croce?
- "Her first morning was ruined,"
- "was ruined, and she might never"
- she might never be in Florence
- be in Florence again.
- A few minutes ago she had been
- ago she had been all high
- "been all high spirits,"
- "talking as a woman of culture,"
- "of culture, and half persuading"
- half persuading herself that she
- herself that she was full of
- she was full of originality.
- Now she entered the church
- the church depressed and
- "depressed and humiliated, not"
- "humiliated, not even able to"
- not even able to remember
- able to remember whether it was
- whether it was built by the
- was built by the Franciscans or
- Franciscans or the Dominicans.
- "Of course, it must be a"
- ", it must be a wonderful"
- be a wonderful building.
- But how like a barn!
- And how very cold!
- "Of course, it contained frescoes"
- "frescoes by Giotto, in the"
- "Giotto, in the presence of whose"
- of whose tactile values she was
- values she was capable of
- was capable of feeling what was
- feeling what was proper.
- But who was to tell her which
- tell her which they were?
- "She walked about disdainfully,"
- "disdainfully, unwilling to be"
- unwilling to be enthusiastic
- be enthusiastic over monuments
- over monuments of uncertain
- of uncertain authorship or date.
- There was no one even to tell
- "one even to tell her which, of"
- "her which, of all the sepulchral"
- the sepulchral slabs that paved
- slabs that paved the nave and
- "the nave and transepts, was the"
- ", was the one that was really"
- "that was really beautiful, the"
- "beautiful, the one that had been"
- that had been most praised by Mr
- praised by Mr. Ruskin.
- Then the pernicious charm of
- "charm of Italy worked on her,"
- "worked on her, and, instead of"
- "and, instead of acquiring"
- "of acquiring information, she"
- "information, she began to be"
- she began to be happy.
- She puzzled out the Italian
- out the Italian notices—the
- notices—the notices that forbade
- that forbade people to introduce
- to introduce dogs into the
- dogs into the church—the notice
- "—the notice that prayed people,"
- "prayed people, in the interest"
- in the interest of health and
- of health and out of respect to
- of respect to the sacred edifice
- sacred edifice in which they
- "in which they found themselves,"
- not to spit.
- She watched the tourists; their
- tourists; their noses were as
- noses were as red as their
- "as red as their Baedekers, so"
- "Baedekers, so cold was Santa"
- cold was Santa Croce.
- She beheld the horrible fate
- horrible fate that overtook
- that overtook three Papists—two
- Papists—two he-babies and a she-
- and a she-baby—who began their
- —who began their career by
- their career by sousing each
- by sousing each other with the
- "other with the Holy Water, and"
- "Holy Water, and then proceeded"
- then proceeded to the
- proceeded to the Machiavelli
- "the Machiavelli memorial,"
- "memorial, dripping but hallowed."
- Advancing towards it very slowly
- it very slowly and from immense
- "and from immense distances, they"
- "distances, they touched the"
- they touched the stone with
- "the stone with their fingers,"
- "their fingers, with their"
- ", with their handkerchiefs, with"
- ", with their heads, and then"
- "heads, and then retreated."
- What could this mean?
- They did it again and again.
- Then Lucy realized that they had
- that they had mistaken
- had mistaken Machiavelli for
- "Machiavelli for some saint,"
- "for some saint, hoping to"
- "saint, hoping to acquire virtue."
- Punishment followed quickly.
- The smallest he-baby stumbled
- he-baby stumbled over one of the
- over one of the sepulchral slabs
- sepulchral slabs so much admired
- so much admired by Mr.
- "Ruskin, and entangled his feet"
- his feet in the features of a
- features of a recumbent bishop.
- "Protestant as she was, Lucy"
- "as she was, Lucy darted forward."
- She was too late.
- He fell heavily upon the
- heavily upon the prelate’s
- the prelate’s upturned toes.
- “Hateful bishop!”
- exclaimed the voice of old Mr.
- "Emerson, who had darted forward"
- darted forward also.
- "“Hard in life, hard in death."
- "Go out into the sunshine, little"
- "sunshine, little boy, and kiss"
- "boy, and kiss your hand to the"
- "your hand to the sun, for that"
- "sun, for that is where you ought"
- where you ought to be.
- Intolerable bishop!”
- The child screamed frantically
- "frantically at these words, and"
- "these words, and at these"
- ", and at these dreadful people"
- dreadful people who picked him
- "who picked him up, dusted him,"
- "up, dusted him, rubbed his"
- "him, rubbed his bruises, and"
- "his bruises, and told him not to"
- told him not to be superstitious
- be superstitious.
- “Look at him!” said Mr.
- said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
- "“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt,"
- "cold, and frightened!"
- But what else can you expect
- can you expect from a church?”
- The child’s legs had become as
- had become as melting wax.
- Each time that old Mr.
- Emerson and Lucy set it erect it
- set it erect it collapsed with a
- collapsed with a roar.
- "Fortunately an Italian lady, who"
- "lady, who ought to have been"
- "to have been saying her prayers,"
- "her prayers, came to the rescue."
- "By some mysterious virtue, which"
- "virtue, which mothers alone"
- "mothers alone possess, she"
- "possess, she stiffened the"
- stiffened the little boy’s back-
- boy’s back-bone and imparted
- and imparted strength to his
- strength to his knees. He stood.
- "Still gibbering with agitation,"
- "with agitation, he walked away."
- "“You are a clever woman,” said"
- "woman,” said Mr. Emerson."
- “You have done more than all the
- than all the relics in the world
- in the world.
- "I am not of your creed, but I do"
- "creed, but I do believe in those"
- believe in those who make their
- who make their fellow-creatures
- fellow-creatures happy.
- There is no scheme of the
- no scheme of the universe—”
- He paused for a phrase.
- "“Niente,” said the Italian lady,"
- "Italian lady, and returned to"
- and returned to her prayers.
- “I’m not sure she understands
- "she understands English,”"
- "English,” suggested Lucy."
- In her chastened mood she no
- mood she no longer despised the
- despised the Emersons.
- She was determined to be
- determined to be gracious to
- "be gracious to them, beautiful"
- "them, beautiful rather than"
- "rather than delicate, and,"
- "if possible, to erase Miss"
- ", to erase Miss Bartlett’s"
- Miss Bartlett’s civility by some
- civility by some gracious
- by some gracious reference to
- reference to the pleasant rooms.
- “That woman understands
- "understands everything,” was Mr."
- Emerson’s reply.
- “But what are you doing here?
- Are you doing the church?
- Are you through with the church?
- with the church?”
- "“No,” cried Lucy, remembering"
- ", remembering her grievance."
- "“I came here with Miss Lavish,"
- "Miss Lavish, who was to explain"
- was to explain everything; and
- everything; and just by the door
- just by the door—it is too bad!—
- —it is too bad!—she simply ran
- "!—she simply ran away, and after"
- "away, and after waiting quite a"
- "waiting quite a time, I had to"
- "a time, I had to come in by"
- to come in by myself.”
- “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr.
- said Mr. Emerson.
- "“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by"
- you come by yourself?”
- "said the son, addressing the"
- ", addressing the young lady for"
- young lady for the first time.
- “But Miss Lavish has even taken
- has even taken away Baedeker.”
- “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
- “I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded
- you minded.
- "It’s worth minding, the loss of"
- ", the loss of a Baedeker."
- _That’s_ worth minding.”
- Lucy was puzzled.
- She was again conscious of some
- "of some new idea, and was not"
- ", and was not sure whither it"
- sure whither it would lead her.
- "“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said"
- "Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d"
- "the son, “you’d better join us.”"
- Was this where the idea would
- the idea would lead?
- She took refuge in her dignity.
- "“Thank you very much, but I"
- "very much, but I could not think"
- could not think of that.
- I hope you do not suppose that I
- suppose that I came to join on
- came to join on to you.
- I really came to help with the
- "to help with the child, and to"
- "child, and to thank you for so"
- thank you for so kindly giving
- so kindly giving us your rooms
- us your rooms last night.
- I hope that you have not been
- have not been put to any great
- put to any great inconvenience.”
- "“My dear,” said the old man"
- "said the old man gently, “I"
- "man gently, “I think that you"
- I think that you are repeating
- are repeating what you have
- what you have heard older people
- older people say.
- You are pretending to be touchy;
- but you are not really.
- "Stop being so tiresome, and tell"
- ", and tell me instead what part"
- what part of the church you want
- church you want to see.
- To take you to it will be a real
- will be a real pleasure.”
- "Now, this was abominably"
- "was abominably impertinent, and"
- "impertinent, and she ought to"
- and she ought to have been
- to have been furious.
- But it is sometimes as difficult
- as difficult to lose one’s
- to lose one’s temper as it is
- temper as it is difficult at
- is difficult at other times to
- other times to keep it.
- Lucy could not get cross. Mr.
- "Emerson was an old man, and"
- "an old man, and surely a girl"
- surely a girl might humour him.
- "On the other hand, his son was a"
- ", his son was a young man, and"
- "a young man, and she felt that a"
- she felt that a girl ought to be
- girl ought to be offended with
- "be offended with him, or at all"
- "him, or at all events be"
- at all events be offended before
- offended before him.
- It was at him that she gazed
- that she gazed before replying.
- "“I am not touchy, I hope."
- It is the Giottos that I want to
- "that I want to see, if you will"
- "see, if you will kindly tell me"
- kindly tell me which they are.”
- The son nodded.
- With a look of sombre
- "a look of sombre satisfaction,"
- "satisfaction, he led the way to"
- led the way to the Peruzzi
- to the Peruzzi Chapel.
- There was a hint of the teacher
- of the teacher about him.
- She felt like a child in school
- child in school who had answered
- who had answered a question
- a question rightly.
- The chapel was already filled
- already filled with an earnest
- "with an earnest congregation,"
- "congregation, and out of them"
- and out of them rose the voice
- "rose the voice of a lecturer,"
- "of a lecturer, directing them"
- ", directing them how to worship"
- "how to worship Giotto, not by"
- "Giotto, not by tactful"
- ", not by tactful valuations, but"
- "valuations, but by the standards"
- by the standards of the spirit.
- "“Remember,” he was saying, “the"
- "was saying, “the facts about"
- “the facts about this church of

- how it was built by faith in the
- by faith in the full fervour of
- "full fervour of medievalism,"
- "of medievalism, before any taint"
- before any taint of the
- any taint of the Renaissance had

- Observe how Giotto in these
- "Giotto in these frescoes—now,"
- "frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined"
- ", ruined by restoration—is"
- restoration—is untroubled by the
- by the snares of anatomy and
- of anatomy and perspective.
- "Could anything be more majestic,"
- "more pathetic, beautiful, true?"
- "How little, we feel, avails"
- "we feel, avails knowledge and"
- knowledge and technical
- and technical cleverness against
- against a man who truly feels!”
- “No!” exclaimed Mr.
- "Emerson, in much too loud a"
- much too loud a voice for church
- voice for church.
- “Remember nothing of the sort!
- Built by faith indeed!
- That simply means the workmen
- the workmen weren’t paid
- weren’t paid properly.
- "And as for the frescoes, I see"
- "frescoes, I see no truth in them"
- no truth in them.
- Look at that fat man in blue!
- "He must weigh as much as I do,"
- "as much as I do, and he is"
- "I do, and he is shooting into"
- is shooting into the sky like an
- the sky like an air balloon.”
- He was referring to the fresco
- to the fresco of the “Ascension
- the “Ascension of St. John.”
- "John.” Inside,"
- "the lecturer’s voice faltered,"
- "voice faltered, as well it might"
- as well it might.
- "The audience shifted uneasily,"
- "uneasily, and so did Lucy."
- She was sure that she ought not
- she ought not to be with these
- to be with these men; but they
- men; but they had cast a spell
- had cast a spell over her.
- They were so serious and so
- serious and so strange that she
- strange that she could not
- she could not remember how to
- remember how to behave.
- "“Now, did this happen, or didn’t"
- ", or didn’t it? Yes or no?”"
- "George replied:"
- "“It happened like this, if it"
- "like this, if it happened at all"
- happened at all.
- I would rather go up to heaven
- go up to heaven by myself than
- by myself than be pushed by
- be pushed by cherubs; and if I
- ; and if I got there I should
- there I should like my friends
- like my friends to lean out of
- "to lean out of it, just as they"
- "it, just as they do here.”"
- "“You will never go up,” said his"
- "go up,” said his father."
- "“You and I, dear boy, will lie"
- "boy, will lie at peace in the"
- at peace in the earth that bore
- "earth that bore us, and our"
- "bore us, and our names will"
- our names will disappear as
- disappear as surely as our work
- as our work survives.”
- “Some of the people can only see
- "can only see the empty grave,"
- "the empty grave, not the saint,"
- "whoever he is, going up."
- "It did happen like that, if it"
- "like that, if it happened at all"
- happened at all.”
- "“Pardon me,” said a frigid voice"
- a frigid voice.
- “The chapel is somewhat small
- somewhat small for two parties.
- We will incommode you no longer.
- you no longer.”
- "The lecturer was a clergyman,"
- "was a clergyman, and his"
- ", and his audience must be also"
- "must be also his flock,"
- for they held prayer-books as
- prayer-books as well as guide-
- well as guide-books in their
- "-books in their hands."
- They filed out of the chapel in
- of the chapel in silence.
- Amongst them were the two little
- the two little old ladies of the
- ladies of the Pension Bertolini—
- Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss
- Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
- “Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
- “There’s plenty of room for us
- of room for us all. Stop!”
- The procession disappeared
- disappeared without a word.
- Soon the lecturer could be heard
- could be heard in the next
- "in the next chapel, describing"
- ", describing the life of St."
- Francis.
- "“George, I do believe that"
- do believe that clergyman is the
- clergyman is the Brixton curate.
- Brixton curate.”
- George went into the next chapel
- "the next chapel and returned,"
- "and returned, saying “Perhaps he"
- “Perhaps he is.
- I don’t remember.”
- “Then I had better speak to him
- speak to him and remind him who
- remind him who I am.
- It’s that Mr.
- Eager. Why did he go?
- Did we talk too loud?
- How vexatious.
- I shall go and say we are sorry.
- Hadn’t I better?
- Then perhaps he will come back.”
- "“He will not come back,” said"

- But Mr.
- "Emerson, contrite and unhappy,"
- "and unhappy, hurried away to"
- hurried away to apologize to the
- apologize to the Rev.
- Cuthbert Eager.
- "Lucy, apparently absorbed in a"

- That was all.
- A crowd rose out of the dusk.

- Mr.

- George Emerson still looked at

- “You fainted.”
- “I—I am very sorry.”
- “How are you now?”
- “Perfectly well—absolutely well.
- absolutely well.”
- And she began to nod and smile.
- “Then let us come home.
- There’s no point in our stopping

- He held out his hand to pull her

- She pretended not to see it.
- The cries from the fountain—they

- “How very kind you have been!
- I might have hurt myself falling

- But now I am well.
- "I can go alone, thank you.”"
- His hand was still extended.
- "“Oh, my photographs!”"
- she exclaimed suddenly.
- “What photographs?”
- “I bought some photographs at

- I must have dropped them out

- She looked at him cautiously.
- “Would you add to your kindness

- The palace tower had lost the

- How should she talk to Mr.
- Emerson when he returned from

- "Being strong physically, she"

- There a cabman signalled to them

- “And the murderer tried to kiss
- "tried to kiss him, you say—how"
- "him, you say—how very odd"

- When my cousin and I were at the
- I were at the Pitti yesterday—
- Pitti yesterday—What was that?”
- He had thrown something into the

- “What did you throw in?”
- "“Things I didn’t want,” he said"

- "“Mr. Emerson!”\n\n“Well?”"
- “Where are the photographs?”
- He was silent.
- “I believe it was my photographs

- Her heart warmed towards him for

- He pointed down-stream.
- “They’ve gone.”
- The river swirled under the

- "them so, and one is so foolish,"
- "is so foolish, it seemed better"
- it seemed better that they
- better that they should go out
- should go out to the sea—I don’t

- Then the boy verged into a man.
- “For something tremendous has

- It isn’t exactly that a man has

- “I want to ask you something

- He was following his own

- “I was never so much ashamed of

- But he lacked chivalry;
- "his thoughts, like his behaviour"

- "It was useless to say to him, “"
- "to say to him, “And would you—”"

- “None but the superficial would
- would be shocked at her.
- We had a long talk yesterday.
- She believes in justice and
- in justice and truth and human
- truth and human interest.
- She told me also that she has a
- that she has a high opinion of
- high opinion of the destiny of
- the destiny of woman—Mr. Eager!
- "Eager! Why, how nice!"
- What a pleasant surprise!”
- "“Ah, not for me,” said the"
- "me,” said the chaplain blandly,"
- "blandly, “for I have been"
- “for I have been watching you
- watching you and Miss
- you and Miss Honeychurch for
- Honeychurch for quite a little
- quite a little time.”
- “We were chatting to Miss Lavish
- to Miss Lavish.”
- His brow contracted.
- “So I saw. Were you indeed?
- Were you indeed? Andate via!
- Andate via! sono occupato!”
- The last remark was made to a
- was made to a vender of
- to a vender of panoramic
- of panoramic photographs who was
- who was approaching with a
- with a courteous smile.
- “I am about to venture a
- to venture a suggestion.
- Would you and Miss Honeychurch
- Miss Honeychurch be disposed to
- be disposed to join me in a
- to join me in a drive some day
- a drive some day this week—a
- day this week—a drive in the
- —a drive in the hills?
- We might go up by Fiesole and
- by Fiesole and back by
- and back by Settignano.
- There is a point on that road
- on that road where we could get
- we could get down and have an
- down and have an hour’s ramble
- an hour’s ramble on the hillside
- on the hillside.
- The view thence of Florence is
- of Florence is most beautiful—
- most beautiful—far better than
- —far better than the hackneyed
- the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
- It is the view that Alessio
- that Alessio Baldovinetti is
- Baldovinetti is fond of
- is fond of introducing into his
- into his pictures.
- That man had a decided feeling
- decided feeling for landscape.
- Decidedly.
- But who looks at it to-day?
- "Ah, the world is too much for us"
- too much for us.”
- Miss Bartlett had not heard of
- had not heard of Alessio
- "heard of Alessio Baldovinetti,"
- "Baldovinetti, but she knew that"
- she knew that Mr.
- Eager was no commonplace
- no commonplace chaplain.
- He was a member of the
- a member of the residential
- the residential colony who had
- colony who had made Florence
- made Florence their home.
- He knew the people who never
- people who never walked about
- "walked about with Baedekers, who"
- "Baedekers, who had learnt to"
- had learnt to take a siesta
- "to take a siesta after lunch,"
- "after lunch, who took drives the"
- took drives the pension tourists
- pension tourists had never heard
- "had never heard of,"
- and saw by private influence

- "Living in delicate seclusion,"
- "seclusion, some in furnished"

- "knowledge, or rather perception,"
- "perception, of Florence which is"
- which is denied to all who carry

- Therefore an invitation from the
- from the chaplain was something
- was something to be proud of.
- Between the two sections of his
- sections of his flock he was
- his flock he was often the only
- "often the only link, and it was"
- "link, and it was his avowed"
- was his avowed custom to select
- custom to select those of his

- "sheep who seemed worthy, and"
- "worthy, and give them a few"
- give them a few hours in the
- few hours in the pastures of the
- pastures of the permanent.
- Tea at a Renaissance villa?
- Nothing had been said about it
- said about it yet.
- But if it did come to that—how
- come to that—how Lucy would
- —how Lucy would enjoy it!
- A few days ago and Lucy would
- and Lucy would have felt the
- have felt the same.
- But the joys of life were
- of life were grouping themselves

- A drive in the hills with Mr.
- Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if
- Bartlett—even if culminating in
- culminating in a residential tea
- residential tea-party—was no
- tea-party—was no longer the
- no longer the greatest of them.
- She echoed the raptures of
- the raptures of Charlotte
- of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
- Only when she heard that Mr.
- Beebe was also coming did her
- coming did her thanks become
- thanks become more sincere.
- “So we shall be a _partie

- ",” said the chaplain."
- “In these days of toil and

- Andate via!
- "andate presto, presto!"
- "Ah, the town!"
- "Beautiful as it is, it is the"

- They assented.
- “This very square—so I am told—

- To one who loves the Florence of
- the Florence of Dante and
- of Dante and Savonarola there is
- there is something portentous in

- desecration—portentous and
- —portentous and humiliating.”
- "“Humiliating indeed,” said Miss"
- ",” said Miss Bartlett."
- “Miss Honeychurch happened to be
- happened to be passing through
- passing through as it happened.
- She can hardly bear to speak of
- bear to speak of it.”
- She glanced at Lucy proudly.
- “And how came we to have you
- we to have you here?”
- asked the chaplain paternally.
- Miss Bartlett’s recent
- recent liberalism oozed away at
- oozed away at the question.
- "“Do not blame her, please, Mr."
- Eager.
- "The fault is mine: I left her"
- "mine: I left her unchaperoned.”"
- "“So you were here alone, Miss"
- "here alone, Miss Honeychurch?”"
- His voice suggested sympathetic
- sympathetic reproof but at the
- but at the same time indicated
- time indicated that a few
- that a few harrowing details
- details would not be
- would not be unacceptable.
- "His dark, handsome face drooped"
- face drooped mournfully towards
- towards her to catch her reply.
- “Practically.”
- “One of our pension

- "brought her home,” said Miss"
- "home,” said Miss Bartlett,"
- "Miss Bartlett, adroitly"
- ", adroitly concealing the sex of"

- “For her also it must have been

- I trust that neither of you was

- Of the many things Lucy was
- "things Lucy was noticing to-day,"
- "noticing to-day, not the least"

- Surely the vendor of photographs

- "Eager, binding their hands"
- their hands together by a long
- by a long glossy ribbon of
- "glossy ribbon of churches,"

- “This is too much!”
- "cried the chaplain, striking"

- She tore.
- A shrill cry rose from the

- "The book it seemed, was more"

- But an Italian can never be

- His mysterious persecution of Mr

- his threats and lamentations.
- He appealed to Lucy;
- would not she intercede?
- He was poor—he sheltered a

- “There! Fly into a stew!
- I can’t help it—had to say it.
- I had to say no.
- He ought never to have asked me.

- “Ridiculous child!”
- cried his mother.
- “You think you’re so holy and
- "so holy and truthful, but really"

- Do you suppose that a man like

- Cecil would take the slightest

- I hope he boxed your ears.
- How dare you say no?”
- "“Oh, do keep quiet, mother!"
- I had to say no when I couldn’t
- when I couldn’t say yes.
- I tried to laugh as if I didn’t
- "as if I didn’t mean what I said,"
- "what I said, and, as Cecil"
- ", and, as Cecil laughed too, and"
- "laughed too, and went away, it"
- "went away, it may be all right."
- But I feel my foot’s in it.
- "Oh, do keep quiet, though, and"

- "“No,” said Mrs."
- "Honeychurch, with the air of one"
- the air of one who has
- of one who has considered the

- You know all that has passed

- ", and yet you deliberately"
- "you deliberately insult him, and"
- "insult him, and try to turn him"
- try to turn him out of my house.
- out of my house.”
- “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
- “I only let out I didn’t like
- I didn’t like him.
- "I don’t hate him, but I don’t"
- "him, but I don’t like him."
- What I mind is that he’ll tell
- that he’ll tell Lucy.”
- He glanced at the curtains
- at the curtains dismally.
- "“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs."
- Honeychurch.
- "“I know his mother; he’s good,"
- "; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s"
- "clever, he’s rich, he’s well"
- "rich, he’s well connected—Oh,"
- "connected—Oh, you needn’t kick"
- you needn’t kick the piano!
- He’s well connected—I’ll say it

- "She paused, as if rehearsing her"
- "rehearsing her eulogy, but her"
- "eulogy, but her face remained"
- face remained dissatisfied.
- "She added: “And he has beautiful"
- he has beautiful manners.”
- “I liked him till just now.
- I suppose it’s having him

- “Mr. Beebe?”
- "said his mother, trying to"

- her interest.
- “I don’t see how Mr.
- Beebe comes in.”
- “You know Mr.
- "Beebe’s funny way, when you"
- "way, when you never quite know"

- "He said: ‘Mr."
- Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’
- "I was very cute, I asked him"

- "He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better"
- like me—better detached.’
- I couldn’t make him say any more

- Since Cecil has come after Lucy

- "he hasn’t been so pleasant, at"
- "so pleasant, at least—I can’t"
- at least—I can’t explain.”
- "“You never can, dear. But I can."
- You are jealous of Cecil because
- of Cecil because he may stop
- he may stop Lucy knitting you
- knitting you silk ties.”
- The explanation seemed plausible
- "seemed plausible, and Freddy"
- ", and Freddy tried to accept it."
- But at the back of his brain
- of his brain there lurked a dim
- lurked a dim mistrust.
- Cecil praised one too much for
- one too much for being athletic.
- Was that it?
- Cecil made one talk in one’s own
- in one’s own way.
- This tired one. Was that it?
- And Cecil was the kind of fellow

- "He must be jealous, or he would"

- “Will this do?”
- called his mother. “‘Dear Mrs.

- just asked my permission about

- "Then I put in at the top, ‘and I"

- "No, I’ll cross that last bit out"

- "Or shall I cross that out,\ntoo?”"
- "“Cross it out, too,” said Freddy"

- Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
- "“Then the whole thing runs: ‘"

- But I do not know—’”
- “Look out!” cried Freddy.
- The curtains parted.
- Cecil’s first movement was one
- movement was one of irritation.
- He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch
- the Honeychurch habit of sitting
- habit of sitting in the dark to
- in the dark to save the
- dark to save the furniture.
- Instinctively he give the

- Light entered.
- "There was revealed a terrace,"
- "a terrace, such as is owned by"

- many villas with trees each side
- "trees each side of it, and on it"
- "of it, and on it a little rustic"

- But it was transfigured by the

- Cecil entered.
- Appearing thus late in the story
- "in the story, Cecil must be at"
- Cecil must be at once described.
- He was medieval.
- Like a Gothic statue.
- "Tall and refined, with shoulders"
- ", with shoulders that seemed"
- that seemed braced square by an
- "square by an effort of the will,"
- "of the will, and a head that was"

- whom the modern world knows as
- world knows as self-
- "knows as self-consciousness, and"

- A Gothic statue implies celibacy
- "implies celibacy, just as a"
- ", just as a Greek statue implies"
- "statue implies fruition, and"
- "fruition, and perhaps this was"
- perhaps this was what Mr.
- Beebe meant.
- "And Freddy, who ignored history"
- "ignored history and art, perhaps"
- "and art, perhaps meant the same"
- meant the same when he failed to

- Mrs.
- Honeychurch left her letter on
- her letter on the writing table
- writing table and moved towards
- moved towards her young
- her young acquaintance.
- "“Oh, Cecil!”"
- "she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do"
- "—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!”"
- "“I promessi sposi,” said he."
- They stared at him anxiously.
- "“She has accepted me,” he said,"
- "me,” he said, and the sound of"
- and the sound of the thing in
- of the thing in English made him
- English made him flush and smile
- "flush and smile with pleasure,"
- "with pleasure, and look more"
- ", and look more human."
- "“I am so glad,” said Mrs."
- "Honeychurch, while Freddy"
- ", while Freddy proffered a hand"
- proffered a hand that was yellow
- that was yellow with chemicals.
- They wished that they also knew
- "they also knew Italian, for our"
- "Italian, for our phrases of"
- our phrases of approval and of
- approval and of amazement are so
- amazement are so connected with
- connected with little occasions
- little occasions that we fear to

- We are obliged to become vaguely
- "become vaguely poetic, or to"
- "poetic, or to take refuge in"
- take refuge in Scriptural
- in Scriptural reminiscences.
- “Welcome as one of the family!”
- said Mrs.
- "Honeychurch, waving her hand at"
- her hand at the furniture.
- “This is indeed a joyous day!
- I feel sure that you will make
- you will make our dear Lucy
- our dear Lucy happy.”
- "“I hope so,” replied the young"
- "the young man, shifting his eyes"
- his eyes to the ceiling.
- “We mothers—” simpered Mrs.
- "Honeychurch, and then realized"
- then realized that she was
- "that she was affected,"
- "was affected, sentimental,"
- ", sentimental, bombastic—all the"
- —all the things she hated most.
- "Why could she not be Freddy, who"
- "be Freddy, who stood stiff in"
- stood stiff in the middle of the
- middle of the room;
- looking very cross and almost
- cross and almost handsome?
- "“I say, Lucy!”"
- "called Cecil, for conversation"
- for conversation seemed to flag.
- Lucy rose from the seat.
- She moved across the lawn and
- "the lawn and smiled in at them,"
- "in at them, just as if she was"
- as if she was going to ask them
- to ask them to play tennis.
- Then she saw her brother’s face.
- "Her lips parted, and she took"
- ", and she took him in her arms."
- "He said, “Steady on!”"
- “Not a kiss for me?”
- asked her mother.
- Lucy kissed her also.
- “Would you take them into the
- them into the garden and tell
- garden and tell Mrs.
- Honeychurch all about it?”
- Cecil suggested.
- “And I’d stop here and tell my
- here and tell my mother.”
- “We go with Lucy?”
- "said Freddy, as if taking orders"
- if taking orders.
- "“Yes, you go with Lucy.”"
- They passed into the sunlight.
- Cecil watched them cross the
- "them cross the terrace,"
- and descend out of sight by the
- of sight by the steps.
- They would descend—he knew their
- —he knew their ways—past the
- "ways—past the shrubbery, and"
- "shrubbery, and past the tennis-"
- past the tennis-lawn and the
- "-lawn and the dahlia-bed,"
- until they reached the kitchen
- "the kitchen garden, and there,"
- ", and there, in the presence of"
- the presence of the potatoes and
- "the potatoes and the peas, the"
- "the peas, the great event would"
- event would be discussed.
- "Smiling indulgently, he lit a"
- ", he lit a cigarette, and"
- "a cigarette, and rehearsed the"
- rehearsed the events that had
- events that had led to such a
- led to such a happy conclusion.
- He had known Lucy for several
- "Lucy for several years, but only"
- "years, but only as a commonplace"
- as a commonplace girl who
- girl who happened to be musical.
- He could still remember his
- remember his depression that
- depression that afternoon at
- "afternoon at Rome, when she and"
- ", when she and her terrible"
- and her terrible cousin fell on
- cousin fell on him out of the
- "him out of the blue, and"
- "of the blue, and demanded to be"
- demanded to be taken to St.
- Peter’s.
- That day she had seemed a
- she had seemed a typical tourist
- "typical tourist—shrill, crude,"
- "—shrill, crude, and gaunt with"
- ", and gaunt with travel."
- But Italy worked some marvel in
- some marvel in her.
- "It gave her light, and—which he"
- ", and—which he held more"
- he held more precious—it gave
- precious—it gave her shadow.
- Soon he detected in her a
- in her a wonderful reticence.
- She was like a woman of Leonardo
- "of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we"
- "Vinci’s, whom we love not so"
- we love not so much for herself
- much for herself as for the
- as for the things that she will
- that she will not tell us.
- The things are assuredly not of
- assuredly not of this life; no
- of this life; no woman of
- ; no woman of Leonardo’s could
- Leonardo’s could have anything
- have anything so vulgar as a “
- so vulgar as a “story.”
- She did develop most wonderfully
- most wonderfully day by day.
- So it happened that from
- that from patronizing civility
- civility he had slowly passed if
- "slowly passed if not to passion,"
- "not to passion, at least to a"
- ", at least to a profound"
- to a profound uneasiness.
- Already at Rome he had hinted to
- he had hinted to her that they
- to her that they might be
- they might be suitable for each
- for each other.
- It had touched him greatly that
- him greatly that she had not
- that she had not broken away at
- broken away at the suggestion.
- Her refusal had been clear and
- been clear and gentle; after it—
- ; after it—as the horrid phrase
- horrid phrase went—she had been
- —she had been exactly the same
- exactly the same to him as
- same to him as before.
- "Three months later, on the"
- "later, on the margin of Italy,"
- "margin of Italy, among the"
- "Italy, among the flower-clad"
- "the flower-clad Alps, he had"
- "Alps, he had asked her again in"
- "her again in bald, traditional"
- ", traditional language."
- She reminded him of a Leonardo
- of a Leonardo more than ever;
- more than ever; her sunburnt
- ; her sunburnt features were
- features were shadowed by
- were shadowed by fantastic rock;
- at his words she had turned and
- had turned and stood between him
- between him and the light with
- the light with immeasurable
- immeasurable plains behind her.
- He walked home with her
- "home with her unashamed,"
- feeling not at all like a
- at all like a rejected suitor.
- The things that really mattered
- really mattered were unshaken.
- So now he had asked her once
- "asked her once more, and, clear"
- "more, and, clear and gentle as"
- "and gentle as ever, she had"
- "as ever, she had accepted him,"
- "accepted him, giving no coy"
- ", giving no coy reasons for her"
- "reasons for her delay, but"
- "her delay, but simply saying"
- simply saying that she loved him
- she loved him and would do her
- and would do her best to make
- her best to make him happy.
- "His mother, too, would be"
- ", too, would be pleased; she had"
- pleased; she had counselled the
- counselled the step; he must
- step; he must write her a long
- write her a long account.
- "Glancing at his hand, in case"
- "hand, in case any of Freddy’s"
- any of Freddy’s chemicals had
- "chemicals had come off on it, he"
- "off on it, he moved to the"
- he moved to the writing table.
- "There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,”"
- followed by many erasures.
- He recoiled without reading any
- "reading any more, and after a"
- ", and after a little hesitation"
- "hesitation sat down elsewhere,"
- "down elsewhere, and pencilled a"
- and pencilled a note on his knee
- note on his knee.
- "Then he lit another cigarette,"
- "cigarette, which did not seem"
- did not seem quite as divine as
- "as divine as the first, and"
- "the first, and considered what"
- considered what might be done to
- might be done to make Windy
- to make Windy Corner drawing-
- Corner drawing-room more
- "-room more distinctive."
- With that outlook it should have
- it should have been a successful
- "a successful room, but the trail"
- ", but the trail of Tottenham"
- of Tottenham Court Road was upon
- Road was upon it; he could
- it; he could almost visualize

- the motor-vans of Messrs.
- Shoolbred and Messrs.
- Maple arriving at the door and
- at the door and depositing this
- "depositing this chair, those"
- "chair, those varnished book-"
- "varnished book-cases, that"
- "book-cases, that writing-table."
- The table recalled Mrs.
- Honeychurch’s letter.
- He did not want to read that
- to read that letter—his
- that letter—his temptations
- —his temptations never lay in
- never lay in that direction; but
- direction; but he worried about
- he worried about it none the
- it none the less.
- It was his own fault that she
- fault that she was discussing
- was discussing him with his
- him with his mother; he had
- mother; he had wanted her
- had wanted her support in his
- support in his third attempt to
- third attempt to win Lucy; he
- to win Lucy; he wanted to feel
- "wanted to feel that others, no"
- "that others, no matter who they"
- "matter who they were, agreed"
- "were, agreed with him, and so he"
- "him, and so he had asked their"
- had asked their permission. Mrs.
- "Honeychurch had been civil, but"
- "been civil, but obtuse in"
- ", but obtuse in essentials,"
- "in essentials, while as for"
- ", while as for Freddy—“He is"
- "Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he"
- "only a boy,” he reflected."
- “I represent all that he
- all that he despises.
- Why should he want me for a
- he want me for a brother-in-law?
- brother-in-law?”
- The Honeychurches were a worthy
- "were a worthy family, but he"
- "family, but he began to realize"
- began to realize that Lucy was
- that Lucy was of another clay;
- of another clay; and perhaps—he
- ; and perhaps—he did not put it
- did not put it very definitely—
- very definitely—he ought to
- —he ought to introduce her into
- her into more congenial circles
- circles as soon as possible.
- “Mr. Beebe!”

- praise of him in her letters

- Cecil greeted him rather
- him rather critically.
- "“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse."
- Do you suppose that I shall get

- “I should say so.
- Food is the thing one does get

- "left a bone in it.”\n\n“Pfui!”"
- "“I know,” said Cecil. “I know."
- “I know. I can’t think why Mrs.

- Mr.

- "who Cissie and Albert might be,"
- "Albert might be, he still"
- "be, he still thought Mr."
- Beebe rather a bounder.
- “Unpardonable question!

- “I’m shockingly stupid over

- "affairs,” said the young man"
- the young man languidly.
- “I can’t even remember the

- Mr.
- "Beebe, distressed at this heavy"
- at this heavy reception of

- determined to shift the subject.
- "“Let me see, Mr."
- Vyse—I forget—what is your

- "“I have no profession,” said"

- “It is another example of my

- “The fault of Euphemia is that

- "“Ah, he has too many."
- No one but his mother can

- Try the faults of Miss

- "“She has none,” said the young"
- "” said the young man, with grave"

- “I quite agree.
- At present she has none.”
- “At present?”
- “I’m not cynical.
- I’m only thinking of my pet

- “You are conscious of having

- Mr.
- Beebe pulled himself together.
- "Really, Mr."

- He was driven to use the

- I foresaw at Florence that her

- I realized dimly enough that she

- She has taken it.
- She has learnt—you will let me

- Cecil had been hesitating

- Do you know any such?”
- “Yes; I met them abroad.”
- “Gentlewomen?”

- I’m really not joking.
- They are quite the right people.
- "Mr. Beebe knows them, too."

- "And oh, the deceit!"
- I have seen a good deal of the

- The deceit of the most promising

- "My dear Lucy, the deceit!”"
- She nodded.
- "“My advice,” put in Mrs."
- "Honeychurch, “is to have nothing"
- to have nothing to do with Lucy
- to do with Lucy and her decayed
- and her decayed gentlewomen at
- gentlewomen at all.
- I know the type.
- Preserve me from people who have
- people who have seen better days

- "“I think I follow you,” said Sir"
- "you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is"
- "; “but it is, as you say, a very"
- "you say, a very sad thing.”"
- “The Misses Alan aren’t that!”
- cried Lucy.
- "“Yes, they are,” said Cecil."
- “I haven’t met them but I should
- but I should say they were a
- say they were a highly

- "“Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—"
- "him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.”"
- "“It’s I who am tiresome,” he"
- "am tiresome,” he replied."
- “I oughtn’t to come with my

- "But really I am so worried, and"
- "so worried, and Lady Otway will"
- Lady Otway will only say that I
- only say that I cannot be too
- "I cannot be too careful, which"
- "careful, which is quite true,"
- "is quite true, but no real help."
- no real help.”
- “Then may I write to my Misses
- "to my Misses Alan?”\n\n“Please!”"
- But his eye wavered when Mrs.
- "Honeychurch exclaimed:"
- “Beware!
- They are certain to have
- certain to have canaries.
- "Sir Harry, beware of canaries:"
- "of canaries: they spit the seed"
- spit the seed out through the
- out through the bars of the
- the bars of the cages and then

- Beware of women altogether.
- Only let to a man.”
- "“Really—” he murmured gallantly,"
- "gallantly, though he saw the"
- he saw the wisdom of her remark.
- “Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
- "If they get drunk, there’s an"
- ", there’s an end of them—they"
- end of them—they lie down
- —they lie down comfortably and
- comfortably and sleep it off.
- "If they’re vulgar,"
- they somehow keep it to
- keep it to themselves.
- It doesn’t spread so.
- "Give me a man—of course,"
- "a man—of course, provided he’s"
- ", provided he’s clean.”"
- Sir Harry blushed.
- Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed
- Cecil enjoyed these open
- these open compliments to their
- to their sex.
- Even the exclusion of the dirty
- of the dirty did not leave them
- not leave them much distinction.
- He suggested that Mrs.
- "Honeychurch, if she had time,"
- should descend from the carriage
- the carriage and inspect “Cissie
- inspect “Cissie” for herself.
- She was delighted.
- Nature had intended her to be
- her to be poor and to live in
- and to live in such a house.
- Domestic arrangements always
- "always attracted her, especially"
- "her, especially when they were"
- when they were on a small scale.
- Cecil pulled Lucy back as she
- Lucy back as she followed her
- she followed her mother.
- “Mrs.
- "Honeychurch,” he said, “what if"
- "said, “what if we two walk home"
- we two walk home and leave you?”
- “Certainly!”
- was her cordial reply.
- Sir Harry likewise seemed almost
- seemed almost too glad to get
- too glad to get rid of them.
- "He beamed at them knowingly,"
- "them knowingly, said, “Aha!"
- "young people, young people!”"
- and then hastened to unlock the
- to unlock the house.
- “Hopeless vulgarian!”
- "exclaimed Cecil, almost before"
- ", almost before they were out of"
- they were out of earshot.
- "“Oh, Cecil!”"
- “I can’t help it.
- It would be wrong not to loathe
- not to loathe that man.”
- "“He isn’t clever, but really he"
- ", but really he is nice.”"
- "“No, Lucy, he stands for all"
- stands for all that is bad in
- that is bad in country life.
- In London he would keep his
- would keep his place.
- He would belong to a brainless
- "to a brainless club, and his"
- "club, and his wife would give"
- wife would give brainless dinner
- brainless dinner parties.
- But down here he acts the little
- acts the little god with his
- "god with his gentility, and his"
- ", and his patronage, and his"
- ", and his sham aesthetics, and"
- "aesthetics, and every one—even"
- every one—even your mother—is
- your mother—is taken in.”
- "“All that you say is quite true,"
- "is quite true,” said Lucy,"
- ",” said Lucy, though she felt"
- though she felt discouraged.
- “I wonder whether—whether it
- —whether it matters so very much
- so very much.”
- “It matters supremely.
- Sir Harry is the essence of that
- essence of that garden-party.
- "Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!"
- How I do hope he’ll get some
- he’ll get some vulgar tenant in
- vulgar tenant in that villa—some
- that villa—some woman so really
- woman so really vulgar that
- vulgar that he’ll notice it.
- _Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
- with his bald head and
- bald head and retreating chin!
- But let’s forget him.”
- This Lucy was glad enough to do.
- If Cecil disliked Sir Harry
- Sir Harry Otway and Mr.
- "Beebe, what guarantee was there"
- was there that the people who
- the people who really mattered
- really mattered to her would
- to her would escape?
- "For instance, Freddy."
- "Freddy was neither clever,"
- "nor subtle, nor beautiful, and"
- "beautiful, and what prevented"
- what prevented Cecil from saying
- "from saying, any minute, “It"
- "any minute, “It would be wrong"
- would be wrong not to loathe
- not to loathe Freddy”?
- And what would she reply?
- Further than Freddy she did not
- "she did not go, but he gave her"
- but he gave her anxiety enough.
- She could only assure herself
- assure herself that Cecil had
- that Cecil had known Freddy some
- "Freddy some time, and that they"
- ", and that they had always got"
- "had always got on pleasantly,"
- "on pleasantly, except, perhaps,"
- "during the last few days, which"
- "few days, which was an accident,"
- "was an accident, perhaps."
- “Which way shall we go?”
- she asked him.
- "Nature—simplest of topics, she"
- "of topics, she thought—was"
- she thought—was around them.
- Summer Street lay deep in the
- "lay deep in the woods, and she"
- "woods, and she had stopped where"
- stopped where a footpath
- where a footpath diverged from
- diverged from the highroad.
- “Are there two ways?”
- “Perhaps the road is more
- "the road is more sensible, as"
- "sensible, as we’re got up smart."
- got up smart.”
- "“I’d rather go through the wood,"
- "the wood,” said Cecil, With that"
- "Cecil, With that subdued"
- that subdued irritation that she
- that she had noticed in him all
- in him all the afternoon.
- "“Why is it,"
- "Lucy, that you always say the"
- always say the road?
- Do you know that you have never
- you have never once been with me
- been with me in the fields or
- in the fields or the wood since
- the wood since we were engaged?”
- “Haven’t I?
- "The wood, then,” said Lucy,"
- ",” said Lucy, startled at his"
- "startled at his queerness, but"
- "queerness, but pretty sure that"
- pretty sure that he would
- that he would explain later; it
- later; it was not his habit to
- not his habit to leave her in
- to leave her in doubt as to his
- doubt as to his meaning.
- She led the way into the
- the way into the whispering
- "the whispering pines, and sure"
- "pines, and sure enough he did"
- enough he did explain before
- explain before they had gone a
- they had gone a dozen yards.
- “I had got an idea—I dare say
- idea—I dare say wrongly—that you
- wrongly—that you feel more at
- you feel more at home with me in
- home with me in a room.”
- “A room?”
- "she echoed, hopelessly"
- ", hopelessly bewildered."
- “Yes.
- "Or, at the most, in a garden, or"
- "in a garden, or on a road."
- Never in the real country like
- country like this.”
- "“Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean"
- do you mean?
- I have never felt anything of
- felt anything of the sort.
- You talk as if I was a kind of
- I was a kind of poetess sort of
- poetess sort of person.”
- “I don’t know that you aren’t.
- I connect you with a view—a
- with a view—a certain type of
- certain type of view.
- Why shouldn’t you connect me
- you connect me with a room?”
- "She reflected a moment, and then"
- "moment, and then said, laughing:"
- “Do you know that you’re right?
- I do.
- I must be a poetess after all.
- When I think of you it’s always
- you it’s always as in a room.
- How funny!”
- "To her surprise, he seemed"
- ", he seemed annoyed."
- "“A drawing-room, pray?"
- With no view?”
- "“Yes, with no view, I fancy."
- Why not?”
- "“I’d rather,” he said"
- "rather,” he said reproachfully,"
- "reproachfully, “that you"
- ", “that you connected me with"
- me with the open air.”
- "She said again, “Oh, Cecil,"
- ", “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you"
- whatever do you mean?”
- As no explanation was
- "explanation was forthcoming, she"
- "forthcoming, she shook off the"
- shook off the subject as too
- subject as too difficult for a
- "difficult for a girl, and led"
- "a girl, and led him further into"
- "him further into the wood,"
- "into the wood, pausing every now"
- every now and then at some
- and then at some particularly
- particularly beautiful or
- beautiful or familiar
- or familiar combination of the
- of the trees.
- She had known the wood between
- the wood between Summer Street
- Summer Street and Windy Corner
- and Windy Corner ever since she
- ever since she could walk alone;
- walk alone; she had played at
- had played at losing Freddy in
- "losing Freddy in it, when Freddy"
- "it, when Freddy was a purple-"
- was a purple-faced baby; and
- "-faced baby; and though she had"
- "though she had been to Italy, it"
- "to Italy, it had lost none of"

- Presently they came to a little
- came to a little clearing among
- clearing among the pines—another
- "pines—another tiny green alp,"
- "tiny green alp, solitary this"
- ", solitary this time, and"
- "this time, and holding in its"

- "She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!"
- The Sacred Lake!”
- “Why do you call it that?”
- “I can’t remember why.
- I suppose it comes out of some

- "It’s only a puddle now, but you"
- "now, but you see that stream"
- see that stream going through it

- "Well, a good deal of water comes"
- of water comes down after heavy

- "heavy rains, and can’t get away"
- "can’t get away at once, and the"
- "at once, and the pool becomes"
- the pool becomes quite large and
- quite large and beautiful.
- Then Freddy used to bathe there.
- He is very fond of it.”
- “And you?”
- "He meant, “Are you fond of it?”"
- "But she answered dreamily, “I"
- "dreamily, “I bathed here, too,"
- "here, too, till I was found out."
- Then there was a row.”
- At another time he might have
- "he might have been shocked, for"
- "shocked, for he had depths of"
- he had depths of prudishness
- of prudishness within him.
- But now?
- with his momentary cult of the
- "cult of the fresh air, he was"
- "air, he was delighted at her"
- delighted at her admirable
- at her admirable simplicity.
- He looked at her as she stood by
- as she stood by the pool’s edge.
- "She was got up smart, as she"
- "up smart, as she phrased it,"
- and she reminded him of some
- him of some brilliant flower
- brilliant flower that has no
- "that has no leaves of its own,"
- "of its own, but blooms abruptly"
- blooms abruptly out of a world
- out of a world of green.
- “Who found you out?”
- "“Charlotte,” she murmured."
- “She was stopping with us.
- Charlotte—Charlotte.”
- “Poor girl!”
- She smiled gravely.
- "A certain scheme, from which"
- ", from which hitherto he had"
- "hitherto he had shrunk, now"
- "had shrunk, now appeared"

- “Lucy!”
- "“Yes, I suppose we ought to be"
- "we ought to be going,” was her"
- "going,” was her reply."
- "“Lucy, I want to ask something"
- to ask something of you that I
- of you that I have never asked
- have never asked before.”
- At the serious note in his voice
- in his voice she stepped frankly
- stepped frankly and kindly
- and kindly towards him.
- "“What, Cecil?”"
- “Hitherto never—not even that
- —not even that day on the lawn
- day on the lawn when you agreed
- when you agreed to marry me—”
- He became self-conscious and
- "-conscious and kept glancing"
- kept glancing round to see if

- "His courage had gone.\n\n“Yes?”"
- “Up to now I have never kissed

- She was as scarlet as if he had
- as if he had put the thing most
- the thing most indelicately.
- "“No—more you have,” she"
- "you have,” she stammered."
- “Then I ask you—may I now?”
- "“Of course, you may, Cecil."
- You might before.

- Did you realize that you would

- “I did not.

- “Cecil has told you to think so.
- You were devoted to her as a

- It is the same with Cecil all

- “By-the-by—I never told you.

- This attempt to divert the
- to divert the conversation was
- "conversation was too puerile,"

- Honeychurch resented it.
- “Since Cecil came back from

- I have something to say to you.
- Did you say you had had a letter

- "“I shall have enough of my own,"
- "of my own, now that you are not"

- Mrs.
- Honeychurch might have flamed
- have flamed out. She did not.
- "She said: “Come here, old lady—"

- Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
- “How well did you know them at

- "“Oh, very slightly."

- "“She was a novelist,” said Lucy"
- ",” said Lucy craftily."
- "The remark was a happy one,"
- for nothing roused Mrs.
- Honeychurch so much as
- so much as literature in the

- She would abandon every topic to

- "Her attitude was: “If books must"

- But soon the conflagration died
- "died down, and the ghosts began"
- the ghosts began to gather in
- to gather in the darkness.
- There were too many ghosts about
- ghosts about.
- The original ghost—that touch of
- —that touch of lips on her cheek
- on her cheek—had surely been
- —had surely been laid long ago;
- laid long ago; it could be
- ago; it could be nothing to her
- nothing to her that a man had

- But it had begotten a spectral

- Beebe’s memories of violets—and

- "“I have been thinking, Lucy, of"

- How is she?”
- “I tore the thing up.”

- "“Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not"
- "so—no—not very cheerful, I"
- "very cheerful, I suppose.”"
- "“Then, depend upon it, it _is_"
- "upon it, it _is_ the boiler."
- I know myself how water preys
- how water preys upon one’s mind.
- I would rather anything else—
- anything else—even a misfortune

- Cecil laid his hand over his
- hand over his eyes.
- "“So would I,” asserted Freddy,"
- "asserted Freddy, backing his"
- ", backing his mother up—backing"
- up—backing up the spirit of her
- spirit of her remark rather than
- rather than the substance.
- "“And I have been thinking,” she"
- "thinking,” she added rather"
- "she added rather nervously, “"
- "nervously, “surely we could"
- “surely we could squeeze

- "next week, and give her a nice"
- give her a nice holiday while
- holiday while the plumbers at
- the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells
- Tunbridge Wells finish.
- I have not seen poor Charlotte

- It was more than her nerves

- And she could not protest

- "“Mother, no!” she pleaded."
- she pleaded. “It’s impossible.
- We can’t have Charlotte on the

- "Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and"
- "Cecil, and you’ve promised to"
- promised to take in Minnie Beebe
- in Minnie Beebe because of the
- because of the diphtheria scare.
- It simply can’t be done.”
- “Nonsense! It can.”
- “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
- Not otherwise.”
- “Minnie can sleep with you.”
- “I won’t have her.”
- "“Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr."
- Floyd must share a room with

- "“Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,"

- "“The truth is, dear, you don’t"
- "dear, you don’t like Charlotte.”"
- "“No, I don’t."
- And no more does Cecil.
- She gets on our nerves.
- "You haven’t seen her lately, and"
- "her lately, and don’t realize"
- don’t realize how tiresome she
- "how tiresome she can be,"
- though so good.
- "So please, mother, don’t worry"
- ", don’t worry us this last"
- us this last summer; but spoil
- ; but spoil us by not asking her
- not asking her to come.”
- "“Hear, hear!” said Cecil."
- Mrs.
- "Honeychurch, with more gravity"
- "more gravity than usual, and"
- "than usual, and with more"
- ", and with more feeling than she"
- feeling than she usually
- than she usually permitted
- "permitted herself, replied: “"
- ", replied: “This isn’t very kind"
- isn’t very kind of you two.
- You have each other and all
- other and all these woods to
- "these woods to walk in, so full"
- "walk in, so full of beautiful"
- of beautiful things; and poor
- things; and poor Charlotte has
- Charlotte has only the water

- turned off and plumbers.
- "You are young, dears, and"
- ", dears, and however clever"
- "however clever young people are,"
- and however many books they read
- "books they read, they will never"
- they will never guess what it
- guess what it feels like to grow
- like to grow old.”
- Cecil crumbled his bread.
- “I must say Cousin Charlotte was
- Charlotte was very kind to me
- very kind to me that year I
- me that year I called on my bike
- "on my bike,” put in Freddy."
- “She thanked me for coming till
- for coming till I felt like such
- "I felt like such a fool, and"
- "such a fool, and fussed round no"
- fussed round no end to get an

- "“I know, dear."
- "She is kind to everyone, and yet"
- ", and yet Lucy makes this"
- Lucy makes this difficulty when
- difficulty when we try to give
- we try to give her some little

- But Lucy hardened her heart.
- It was no good being kind to
- being kind to Miss Bartlett.
- She had tried herself too often
- too often and too recently.
- One might lay up treasure in
- up treasure in heaven by the
- "in heaven by the attempt, but"
- "the attempt, but one enriched"
- but one enriched neither Miss
- neither Miss Bartlett nor any
- Bartlett nor any one else upon
- one else upon earth.
- "She was reduced to saying: “I"
- "to saying: “I can’t help it,"
- "I can’t help it, mother."
- I don’t like Charlotte.
- I admit it’s horrid of me.”
- "“From your own account, you told"
- ", you told her as much.”"
- "“Well, she would leave Florence"
- leave Florence so stupidly.
- She flurried—”
- The ghosts were returning; they
- "returning; they filled Italy,"
- "filled Italy, they were even"
- ", they were even usurping the"
- usurping the places she had
- places she had known as a child.
- The Sacred Lake would never be
- "would never be the same again,"
- "the same again, and, on Sunday"
- ", and, on Sunday week, something"
- "week, something would even"
- would even happen to Windy
- happen to Windy Corner.
- How would she fight against
- fight against ghosts?
- For a moment the visible world
- "visible world faded away, and"
- "faded away, and memories and"
- and memories and emotions alone
- emotions alone seemed real.
- “I suppose Miss Bartlett must
- "Bartlett must come, since she"
- "come, since she boils eggs so"
- "boils eggs so well,” said Cecil,"
- ",” said Cecil, who was in rather"
- was in rather a happier frame of
- "happier frame of mind, thanks to"
- "mind, thanks to the admirable"

- “I didn’t mean the egg was
- "mean the egg was _well_ boiled,”"
- "_well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy"
- "corrected Freddy, “because in"
- ", “because in point of fact she"
- of fact she forgot to take it
- "to take it off, and as a matter"
- and as a matter of fact I don’t
- of fact I don’t care for eggs.
- I only meant how jolly kind she
- jolly kind she seemed.”
- Cecil frowned again.
- "Oh, these Honeychurches!"
- "Eggs, boilers,"
- "hydrangeas, maids—of such were"
- —of such were their lives
- were their lives compact.
- “May me and Lucy get down from
- get down from our chairs?”
- "he asked, with scarcely veiled"
- scarcely veiled insolence.
- “We don’t want no dessert.”

- Of course Miss Bartlett accepted

- "And, equally of course, she felt"

- If at times strange images rose
- "images rose from the depths, she"
