- "A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of "
- "text, separated\n"
- "by one or more blank lines. "
- "(A blank line is any line that looks like\n"
- "a blank line -- a line containing nothing but "
- "spaces or tabs is\n"
- "considered blank.) "
- "Normal paragraphs should not be indented with\n"
- "spaces or tabs.\n\n"
- "Markdown offers two styles of headers: *"
- Setext* and *atx*
- ".\nSetext-style headers for "
- "`<h1>` and `<"
- "h2>` are created by\n\"underlining"
- "\" with equal signs (`=`) and "
- "hyphens (`-`), "
- "respectively.\n"
- "To create an atx-style header, you "
- "put 1-6 hash marks (`#"
- "`) at the\nbeginning of the line --"
- " the number of hashes equals the resulting\n"
- "HTML header level.\n\n"
- "Blockquotes are indicated using email-style "
- "'`>`' angle brackets.\n\n"

- "### Phrase Emphasis ##"
- "#\n\n"
- "Markdown uses asterisks and "
- "underscores to indicate spans of emphasis.\n\n"
- "Markdown:\n\n    "
- "Some of these words *are emphasized*.\n"
- "    Some of these words _are emphasized also_.\n\n    "
- "Use two asterisks for **strong "
- "emphasis**.\n    "
- "Or, if you prefer, __use two "
- "underscores instead__.\n\nOutput:\n\n    "
- "<p>Some of these words <em>"
- "are emphasized</em>.\n    "
- Some of these words <em>are emphasized also
- "</em>.</p>\n\n    "
- "<p>Use two asterisks for "
- "<strong>strong emphasis</strong>.\n    "
- "Or, if you prefer, <strong>use "
- two underscores instead</strong>.
- "</p>\n\n\n\n"
- "## Lists ##\n\n"
- "Unordered (bulleted) lists use "
- "asterisks, pluses, and "
- "hyphens (`*`,\n"
- "`+`, and `-`) as "
- "list markers. These three markers are\n"
- "interchangable; this:\n\n    "
- "*   Candy.\n    *   Gum.\n"
- "    *   Booze.\n\nthis:\n\n    "
- "+   Candy.\n    +   Gum.\n"
- "    +   Booze.\n\nand this:\n\n    "
- "-   Candy.\n    -   Gum.\n"
- "    -   Booze.\n\n"
- "all produce the same output:\n\n    "
- "<ul>\n"
- "    <li>Candy.</li"
- ">\n    "
- "<li>Gum.</"
- "li>\n    "
- "<li>Booze.</"
- "li>\n    </ul>\n\n"
- "Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, "
- "followed by periods, as\nlist markers:\n\n    "
- "1.  Red\n    2.  Green\n    3.  Blue\n"
- "\nOutput:\n\n    "
- "<ol>\n"
- "    <li>Red</li>\n    "
- "<li>Green</li>\n    "
- "<li>Blue</li>\n    "
- "</ol>\n\n"
- "If you put blank lines between items, "
- "you'll get `<p>` tags "
- "for the\n"
- "list item text. "
- "You can create multi-paragraph list items by "
- "indenting\n"
- the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab
- ":\n\n    "
- "*   A list item.\n\n        With multiple paragraphs.\n\n"
- "    *   Another item in the list.\n\nOutput:\n\n    "
- "<ul>\n"
- "    <li><p>A list item"

- "<p>With multiple paragraphs.</"
- "p></li>\n    "
- "<li><p>Another item in "
- the list.</p></
- "li>\n    </ul>\n\n\n\n"
- "### Links ###\n\n"
- "Markdown supports two styles for creating links: *"
- "inline* and\n*reference*"
- ". "
- "With both styles, you use square brackets to "
- "delimit the\n"
- "text you want to turn into a link.\n\n"
- "Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after "
- "the link text.\nFor example:\n\n    "
- "This is an [example link](http:"
- "//example.com/).\n\n"
- "Output:\n\n    "
- "<p>This is an <a "
- "href=\"http://"
- "example.com/\">\n    "
- example link</a>.</p
- ">\n\n"
- "Optionally, you may include a title attribute "
- "in the parentheses:\n\n    "
- "This is an [example link](http:"
- "//example.com/ \"With a Title"
- "\").\n\nOutput:\n\n    "
- "<p>This is an <a "
- "href=\"http://"
- "example.com/\" title=\"With a "
- "Title\">\n    "
- example link</a>.</p
- ">\n\n"
- "Reference-style links allow you to refer to your "
- "links by names, which\n"
- "you define elsewhere in your document:\n\n    "
- "I get 10 times more traffic from [Google]"
- "[1] than from\n    "
- "[Yahoo][2] or [MSN"
- "][3].\n\n    "
- "[1]: http://"
- "google.com/        \"Google\"\n    "
- "[2]: http://"
- "search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo "
- "Search\"\n    "
- "[3]: http://"
- "search.msn.com/    \""
- "MSN Search\"\n\nOutput:\n\n    "
- "<p>I get 10 times more traffic from "
- "<a href=\"http:/"
- "/google.com/\"\n    "
- "title=\"Google\">Google</a"
- "> than from <a href=\""
- "http://"
- "search.yahoo.com/\"\n    "
- "title=\"Yahoo Search\">Yahoo</"
- "a> or <a href=\""
- "http://"
- "search.msn.com/\"\n    "
- "title=\"MSN Search\">MSN"
- "</a>.</p>\n\n"
- "The title attribute is optional. "
- "Link names may contain letters,\n"
- "numbers and spaces, but are *not* case "
- "sensitive:\n\n    "
- "I start my morning with a cup of coffee and\n"
- "    [The New York Times][NY Times]"
- ".\n\n    "
- "[ny times]: http://"
- "www.nytimes.com/\n\n"
- "Output:\n\n    "
- "<p>I start my morning with a cup "
- "of coffee and\n    "
- "<a href=\"http:/"
- "/www.nytimes.com/\""
- ">The New York Times</a>."
- "</p>\n\n\n"
- "### Images ###\n\n"
- "Image syntax is very much like link syntax.\n\n"
- "Inline (titles are optional):\n\n    "
- "!["
- "alt text](/path/to/"
- "img.jpg \"Title\")\n\n"
- "Reference-style:\n\n    "
- "![alt text][id]\n\n"
- "    [id]: /path/to/"
- "img.jpg \"Title\"\n\n"
- "Both of the above examples produce the same output:\n\n    "
- "<img src=\"/path/"
- "to/img.jpg\" "
- "alt=\"alt text\" title="
- "\"Title\" />\n\n\n\n"
- "### Code ###\n\n"
- "In a regular paragraph, you can create code span "
- "by wrapping text in\n"
- backtick quotes. Any ampersands (
- "`&`) and angle brackets (`<"
- "` or\n`>`"
- ) will automatically be translated into HTML entities
- ". This makes\n"
- "it easy to use Markdown to write about "
- "HTML example code:\n\n    "
- "I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>"
- "` tags.\n\n    "
- "I wish SmartyPants used named entities like "
- "`&mdash;`\n    "
- "instead of decimal-encoded entities like `&"
- "#8212;`.\n\nOutput:\n\n    "
- "<p>I strongly recommend against using any\n"
- "    <code>&lt;blink&"
- gt;</code> tags.<
- "/p>\n\n    "
- "<p>I wish SmartyPants used "
- "named entities like\n    "
- "<code>&amp;mdash"
- ;</code> instead of decimal-
- "encoded\n    "
- "entities like <code>&amp;#"
- 8212;</code>.</
- "p>\n\n\n"
- "To specify an entire block of pre-formatted "
- "code, indent every line of\n"
- "the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. "
- "Just like with code spans, `&`, "
- "`<`,\nand `>`"
- " characters will be escaped automatically.\n\nMarkdown:\n\n    "
- "If you want your page to validate under "
- "XHTML 1.0 Strict,\n    "
- "you've got to put paragraph tags in your "
- "blockquotes:\n\n    "
- "    <blockquote>\n    "
- "        <p>For example.</p>\n    "
- "    </blockquote>\n\nOutput:\n\n    "
- "<p>If you want your page to "
- "validate under XHTML 1.0 "
- "Strict,\n    "
- "you've got to put paragraph tags in your "
- "blockquotes:</p>\n\n    "
