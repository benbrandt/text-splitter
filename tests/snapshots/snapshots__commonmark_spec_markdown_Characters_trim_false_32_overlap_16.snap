- "# Introduction\n\n"
- "## What is Markdown?\n\n"
- "Markdown is a plain text format "
- " text format for writing "
- " for writing structured "
- " structured documents,\n"
- "based on conventions for "
- "conventions for indicating "
- " for indicating formatting in "
- " formatting in email\n"
- "and usenet posts.  "
- "It was developed by John Gruber "
- " by John Gruber (with\n"
- "help from Aaron Swartz) and "
- " Swartz) and released in 2004 in"
- " in 2004 in the form of a\n"
- "[syntax description](https://"
- "](https://daringfireball.net/"
- "/projects/markdown/syntax)\n"
- "and a Perl script (`Markdown.pl`"
- ") for converting Markdown to\n"
- "HTML.  "
- "In the next decade, dozens of "
- ", dozens of implementations were"
- "\n"
- "developed in many languages.  "
- "Some extended the original\n"
- Markdown syntax with conventions
- "with conventions for footnotes, "
- " for footnotes, tables, and\n"
- "other document elements.  "
- "Some allowed Markdown documents "
- " documents to be\n"
- "rendered in formats other than "
- " other than HTML.  "
- "Websites like Reddit,\n"
- "StackOverflow, and GitHub had "
- " and GitHub had millions of "
- "had millions of people using "
- "of people using Markdown.\n"
- "And Markdown started to be used "
- " to be used beyond the web, to "
- " the web, to author books,\n"
- "articles, slide shows, letters, "
- "shows, letters, and lecture "
- ", and lecture notes.\n\n"
- What distinguishes Markdown from
- " Markdown from many other "
- "from many other lightweight "
- " lightweight markup\n"
- "syntaxes, which are often easier"
- "are often easier to write, is "
- " to write, is its readability.\n"
- "As Gruber writes:\n\n"
- "> "
- "The overriding design goal for "
- "design goal for Markdown'"
- "'s formatting syntax is\n> "
- "to make it as readable as "
- " as readable as possible. "
- "The idea is that a\n> "
- "Markdown-formatted document "
- " document should be publishable "
- " be publishable as-is, as\n> "
- "plain text, without looking like"
- " looking like it'"
- "'s been marked up with tags\n> "
- "\n> or formatting instructions."
- "\n> ("
- "<https://daringfireball.net/"
- "/projects/markdown/>)\n\n"
- "The point can be illustrated by "
- " illustrated by comparing a "
- " by comparing a sample of\n"
- "[AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/"
- "://asciidoc.org/) with\n"
- an equivalent sample of Markdown
- " of Markdown.  "
- "Here is a sample of\n"
- "AsciiDoc from the AsciiDoc "
- " the AsciiDoc manual:\n\n"
- "```\n"
- "1. List item one.\n+\n"
- "List item one continued with a "
- " with a second paragraph "
- " paragraph followed by an\n"
- "Indented block.\n+\n"
- "+\n.................\n$ ls *.sh\n"
- "$ ls *.sh\n$ mv *.sh ~/tmp\n"
- ".................\n+\n"
- List item continued with a third
- " with a third paragraph.\n\n2. "
- "List item two continued with an "
- " with an open block.\n+\n--\n"
- "This paragraph is part of the "
- " is part of the preceding list "
- " preceding list item.\n\na. "
- This list is nested and does not

- "This paragraph is part of the "

- "\nb. List item b.\n\n"
- "This paragraph belongs to item "

- " side-by-side Markdown and\n"
- "HTML.  "
- "These are intended to double as "
- " to double as conformance tests."

- " spec says what counts as a link"
- "\ndestination, but it doesn'"
- "t mandate that non-ASCII "
- " that non-ASCII characters in\n"
- "the URL be percent-encoded.  "
- "To use the automatic tests,\n"

- " a renderer that conforms to\n"
- "the expectations of the spec "
- " of the spec examples (percent-"
- " (percent-encoding\n"
- "non-ASCII characters in URLs).  "
- "But a conforming implementation\n"

- used in the CommonMark reference
- " reference implementations.\n\n"
- "## Overview\n\n"
- "Parsing has two phases:\n"
- "\n1. "
- "In the first phase, lines of "
- "phase, lines of input are "
- " of input are consumed and the "
- " and the block\n"
- structure of the document---
- "its division into paragraphs, "
- " paragraphs, block quotes,\n"
- "list items, and so on---"
- "is constructed.  "
- "Text is assigned to these\n"
- "blocks but not parsed. "
- "Link reference definitions are "
- "definitions are parsed and a\n"
- "map of links is constructed.\n\n"
- "2. "
- "In the second phase, the raw "
- " phase, the raw text contents of"
- "text contents of paragraphs and "
- " paragraphs and headings\n"
- "are parsed into sequences of "
- " sequences of Markdown inline "
- Markdown inline elements (
- " elements (strings,\n"
- "code spans, links, emphasis, and"
- ", emphasis, and so on), using "
- " so on), using the map of link\n"
- "references constructed in phase "
- " in phase 1.\n\n"
- "At each point in processing, the"
- " processing, the document is "
- the document is represented as a
- "represented as a tree of\n"
- "**blocks**"
- ".  The root of the tree is a "
- "`document` block.  The "
- " block.  The `document`\n"
- "may have any number of other "
- "number of other blocks as "
- "**children**.  These children\n"
- "may, in turn, have other blocks "
- " other blocks as children.  "
- "The last child of a block\n"
- is normally considered **open**
- ", meaning that subsequent lines "
- " lines of input\n"
- "can alter its contents.  "
- "(Blocks that are not open are "
- "**closed**.)\n"
- "Here, for example, is a possible"

- "```\n\n"
- "## Phase 1: block structure\n\n"
- "Each line that is processed has "
- " processed has an effect on this"
- " effect on this tree.  "
- "The line is\n"
- "analyzed and, depending on its "
- " on its contents, the document "
- ", the document may be altered\n"
- "in one or more of the following "
- " the following ways:\n\n"
- "1. "
- "One or more open blocks may be "

- "2. "
- "One or more new blocks may be "
- " blocks may be created as "
- " be created as children of the\n"
- "\n   last open block.\n"
- "3. "
- Text may be added to the last (
- " to the last (deepest) open "
- " (deepest) open block remaining\n"
- "\n   on the tree.\n\n"
- "Once a line has been "
- "a line has been incorporated "
- " incorporated into the tree in "
- " the tree in this way,\n"
- "it can be discarded, so input "
- ", so input can be read in a "
- " be read in a stream.\n\n"
- "For each line, we follow this "
- " we follow this procedure:\n\n"
- "1. "
- "First we iterate through the "
- " through the open blocks, "
- " open blocks, starting with the\n"
- "root document, and descending "
- " and descending through last "
- " through last children down to "
- " down to the last\n"
- "open block.  "
- "Each block imposes a condition "
- " a condition that the line must "
- " the line must satisfy\n"
- if the block is to remain open.
- " to remain open.  "
- "For example, a block quote "
- ", a block quote requires a\n`>`"
- " character.  "
- A paragraph requires a non-blank
- " a non-blank line.\n"
- "In this phase we may match all "
- " may match all or just some of "
- "or just some of the open\n"
- "blocks.  "
- "But we cannot close unmatched "
- "close unmatched blocks yet, "
- " blocks yet, because we may have"
- " we may have a\n["
- "[lazy continuation line].\n\n"
- "2.  "
- "Next, after consuming the "
- " consuming the continuation "
- " continuation markers for "
- " markers for existing\n"
- "blocks, we look for new block "
- " for new block starts (e.g. `>`"
- "`>` for a block quote).\n"
- "If we encounter a new block "
- " a new block start, we close any"
- ", we close any blocks unmatched\n"
- "in step 1 before creating the "
- " creating the new block as a "
- " new block as a child of the "
- " a child of the last\n"
- "matched container block.\n\n"
- "3.  "
- "Finally, we look at the "
- " we look at the remainder of the"
- "remainder of the line (after "
- "the line (after block\n"
- "markers like `>`"
- ", list markers, and indentation "
- "and indentation have been "
- " have been consumed).\n"
- "This is text that can be "
- " that can be incorporated into "
- " into the last open\n"
- "block (a paragraph, code block, "
- ", code block, heading, or raw "
