- "<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"philosophy\">Philosophy</h3>"
- Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
- "Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted"
- "document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking\nlike it'"
- "s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While\nMarkdown'"
- "s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML\nfilters -- including [Setext][1], [atx"
- "][2], [Textile][3], [reStructuredText][4],\n[Grutatext][5], and [EtText][6] --"
- "the single biggest source of\ninspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email."

- "[6]: http://ettext.taint.org/doc/\n\nTo this end, Markdown'"
- s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation
- "characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so"
- "as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually\nlook like \\*emphasis\\"
- "*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even"
- "blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you've ever\nused email."
- "<h3 id=\"html\">Inline HTML</h3>"
- "Markdown's syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a\nformat for *writing* for the web."
- "Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its"
- "syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of\nHTML tags. The idea is *not*"
- to create a syntax that makes it easier
- "to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to"
- "insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and\nedit prose. HTML is a *"
- "publishing* format; Markdown is a *writing*\nformat. Thus, Markdown'"
- "s formatting syntax only addresses issues that\ncan be conveyed in plain text."
- "For any markup that is not covered by Markdown's syntax, you simply\nuse HTML itself. There'"
- "s no need to preface it or delimit it to\nindicate that you'"
- "re switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use\nthe tags."
- "The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements -- e.g. `<div>`,\n`<table>`, `<pre>`, `<p>`"
- ", etc. -- must be separated from surrounding"
- "content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should"
- "not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not\nto add extra (unwanted) `<p>`"
- "tags around HTML block-level tags.\n\nFor example, to add an HTML table to a Markdown article:"
- "This is a regular paragraph.\n\n    <table>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Foo</td>\n        </tr>"
- "</table>\n\n    This is another regular paragraph."
- "Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level\nHTML tags. E.g., you can'"
- "t use Markdown-style `*emphasis*` inside an\nHTML block.\n\nSpan-level HTML tags -- e.g. `<span>`,"
- "`<cite>`, or `<del>`"
- "-- can be\nused anywhere in a Markdown paragraph, list item, or header. If you"
- "want, you can even use HTML tags instead of Markdown formatting; e.g. if\nyou'd prefer to use HTML"
- "`<a>` or `<img>`"
- "tags instead of Markdown's\nlink or image syntax, go right ahead."
- "Unlike block-level HTML tags, Markdown syntax *is* processed within\nspan-level tags."
- "<h3 id=\"autoescape\">Automatic Escaping for Special Characters</h3>"
- "In HTML, there are two characters that demand special treatment: `<`\nand `&`"
- ". Left angle brackets are used to start tags; ampersands are"
- used to denote HTML entities. If you want to use them as literal
- "characters, you must escape them as entities, e.g. `&lt;`, and\n`&amp;`"
- ".\n\nAmpersands in particular are bedeviling for web writers. If you want to\nwrite about 'AT&T'"
- ", you need to write '`AT&amp;T`"
- "'. You even need to\nescape ampersands within URLs. Thus, if you want to link to:"
- "http://images.google.com/images?num=30&q=larry+bird\n\nyou need to encode the URL as:"
- "http://images.google.com/images?num=30&amp;q=larry+bird\n\nin your anchor tag `href`"
- "attribute. Needless to say, this is easy to"
- "forget, and is probably the single most common source of HTML validation"
- errors in otherwise well-marked-up web sites.
- "Markdown allows you to use these characters naturally, taking care of"
- all the necessary escaping for you. If you use an ampersand as part of
- "an HTML entity, it remains unchanged; otherwise it will be translated\ninto `&amp;`"
- ".\n\nSo, if you want to include a copyright symbol in your article, you can write:\n\n    &copy;"
- "and Markdown will leave it alone. But if you write:\n\n    AT&T\n\nMarkdown will translate it to:"
- "AT&amp;T\n\nSimilarly, because Markdown supports [inline HTML](#html), if you use"
- "angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markdown will treat them as\nsuch. But if you write:"
- "4 < 5\n\nMarkdown will translate it to:\n\n    4 &lt; 5"
- "However, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle brackets and\nampersands are *always*"
- encoded automatically. This makes it easy to use
- "Markdown to write about HTML code. (As opposed to raw HTML, which is a"
- "terrible format for writing about HTML syntax, because every single `<`\nand `&`"
- "in your example code needs to be escaped.)\n\n\n* * *"
- "<h2 id=\"block\">Block Elements</h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"p\">Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h3>"
- "A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated"
- "by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a\nblank line --"
- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered
- "blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.\n\nThe implication of the \""
- "one or more consecutive lines of text\" rule is\nthat Markdown supports \"hard-wrapped\""
- text paragraphs. This differs
- "significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable\nType's \"Convert Line Breaks"
- "\" option) which translate every line break\ncharacter in a paragraph into a `<br />`"
- "tag.\n\nWhen you *do* want to insert a `<br />`"
- "break tag using Markdown, you\nend a line with two or more spaces, then type return."
- "Yes, this takes a tad more effort to create a `<br />`, but a simplistic\n\"every line break is a"
- "`<br />`"
- "\" rule wouldn't work for Markdown.\nMarkdown's email-style [blockquoting][bq] and multi-paragraph ["
- "list items][l]\nwork best -- and look better -- when you format them with hard breaks."
- "[bq]: #blockquote\n  [l]:  #list\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"header\">Headers</h3>"
- "Markdown supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and [atx] [2].\n\nSetext-style headers are \""
- "underlined\" using equal signs (for first-level"
- "headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). For example:\n\n    This is an H1\n    ============="
- "This is an H2\n    -------------\n\nAny number of underlining `=`'s or `-`"
- "'s will work.\n\nAtx-style headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line,"
- "corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:\n\n    # This is an H1\n\n    ## This is an H2"
- "###### This is an H6\n\nOptionally, you may \"close\" atx-style headers. This is purely\ncosmetic --"
- "you can use this if you think it looks better. The\nclosing hashes don'"
- "t even need to match the number of hashes\nused to open the header. (The number of opening hashes"
- "determines the header level.) :\n\n    # This is an H1 #\n\n    ## This is an H2 ##"
- "### This is an H3 ######\n\n\n<h3 id=\"blockquote\">Blockquotes</h3>\n\nMarkdown uses email-style `>`"
- "characters for blockquoting. If you're"
- "familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you"
- "know how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard\nwrap the text and put a `>`"
- "before every line:\n\n    > This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,"
- "> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus."
- "> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n    >"
- "> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse"
- "> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nMarkdown allows you to be lazy and only put the `>`"
- "before the first\nline of a hard-wrapped paragraph:"
- "> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,"
- consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
- "Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus."
- "> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse"
- id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
- "Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by\nadding additional levels of `>`"
- ":\n\n    > This is the first level of quoting.\n    >\n    > > This is nested blockquote.\n    >"
- "> Back to the first level."
- "Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists,\nand code blocks:\n\n\t> ##"
- "This is a header.\n\t>\n\t> 1.   This is the first list item.\n\t> 2.   This is the second list item."
- ">\n\t> Here's some example code:\n\t>\n\t>     return shell_exec(\"echo $input | $markdown_script\");"
- Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For
- "example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase\nQuote Level from the Text menu."
- "<h3 id=\"list\">Lists</h3>"
- Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.
- "Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens -- interchangably\n-- as list markers:"
- "*   Red\n    *   Green\n    *   Blue\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n    +   Red\n    +   Green\n    +   Blue\n\nand:"
- "-   Red\n    -   Green\n    -   Blue\n\nOrdered lists use numbers followed by periods:\n\n    1.  Bird"
- "2.  McHale\n    3.  Parish\n\nIt's important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the"
- list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTML
- "Markdown produces from the above list is:\n\n    <ol>\n    <li>Bird</li>\n    <li>McHale</li>"
- "<li>Parish</li>\n    </ol>\n\nIf you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:\n\n    1.  Bird"
- "1.  McHale\n    1.  Parish\n\nor even:\n\n    3. Bird\n    1. McHale\n    8. Parish\n\nyou'"
- "d get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to,"
- "you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that"
- the numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML.
- "But if you want to be lazy, you don't have to."
- "If you do use lazy list numbering, however, you should still start the"
- "list with the number 1. At some point in the future, Markdown may support"
- starting ordered lists at an arbitrary number.
- "List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by"
- "up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more spaces\nor a tab."
- "To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:"
- "*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit."
- "Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,"
- "viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus."
- "*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit."
- "Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nBut if you want to be lazy, you don'"
- "t have to:\n\n    *   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit."
- "Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,"
- "viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus."
- "*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit."
- Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
- "If list items are separated by blank lines, Markdown will wrap the\nitems in `<p>`"
- "tags in the HTML output. For example, this input:\n\n    *   Bird\n    *   Magic\n\nwill turn into:"
- "<ul>\n    <li>Bird</li>\n    <li>Magic</li>\n    </ul>\n\nBut this:\n\n    *   Bird\n\n    *   Magic"
- "will turn into:\n\n    <ul>\n    <li><p>Bird</p></li>\n    <li><p>Magic</p></li>\n    </ul>"
- List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent
- "paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces\nor one tab:"
- 1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
- "sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit\n        mi posuere lectus."
- "Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet"
- "vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum\n        sit amet velit."
- 2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
- It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent
- "paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be\nlazy:"
- "*   This is a list item with two paragraphs."
- "This is the second paragraph in the list item. You're"
- only required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor
- "sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n\n    *   Another item in the same list."
- "To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote's `>`"
- "delimiters need to be indented:\n\n    *   A list item with a blockquote:"
- "> This is a blockquote\n        > inside a list item."
- "To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs\nto be indented *twice* --"
- "8 spaces or two tabs:\n\n    *   A list item with a code block:\n\n            <code goes here>\n\n\nIt'"
- "s worth noting that it's possible to trigger an ordered list by"
- "accident, by writing something like this:\n\n    1986. What a great season.\n\nIn other words, a *"
- number-period-space* sequence at the beginning of a
- "line. To avoid this, you can backslash-escape the period:\n\n    1986\\. What a great season."
- "<h3 id=\"precode\">Code Blocks</h3>"
- Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or
- "markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines"
- "of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block\nin both `<pre>` and `<code>`"
- "tags.\n\nTo produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the"
- "block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:\n\n    This is a normal paragraph:"
- "This is a code block.\n\nMarkdown will generate:\n\n    <p>This is a normal paragraph:</p>"
- "<pre><code>This is a code block.\n    </code></pre>\n\nOne level of indentation -- 4 spaces or 1 tab --"
- "is removed from each\nline of the code block. For example, this:"
- "Here is an example of AppleScript:\n\n        tell application \"Foo\"\n            beep\n        end tell"
- "will turn into:\n\n    <p>Here is an example of AppleScript:</p>"
- "<pre><code>tell application \"Foo\"\n        beep\n    end tell\n    </code></pre>"
- "A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented\n(or the end of the article)."
- "Within a code block, ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` and `>`"
- ")\nare automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very"
- easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown -- just paste
- "it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the"
- "ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:\n\n        <div class=\"footer\">"
- "&copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n        </div>\n\nwill turn into:"
- "<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"footer\"&gt;\n        &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n    &lt;/div&gt;"
- "</code></pre>\n\nRegular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,"
- "asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means\nit'"
- "s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown's own syntax."
- "<h3 id=\"hr\">Horizontal Rules</h3>\n\nYou can produce a horizontal rule tag (`<hr />`"
- ") by placing three or\nmore hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. If you"
- "wish, you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the"
- "following lines will produce a horizontal rule:\n\n    * * *\n\n    ***\n\n    *****\n\n    - - -"
- "---------------------------------------\n\n\n* * *"
- "<h2 id=\"span\">Span Elements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"link\">Links</h3>"
- "Markdown supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*."
- "In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets]."
- "To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately\nafter the link text'"
- "s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,"
- "put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an *optional*"
- "title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:"
- "This is [an example](http://example.com/ \"Title\") inline link."
- "[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.\n\nWill produce:"
- "<p>This is <a href=\"http://example.com/\" title=\"Title\">\n    an example</a> inline link.</p>"
- "<p><a href=\"http://example.net/\">This link</a> has no\n    title attribute.</p>\n\nIf you'"
- "re referring to a local resource on the same server, you can\nuse relative paths:"
- "See my [About](/about/) page for details."
- "Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside"
- "which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:"
- "This is [an example][id] reference-style link."
- "You can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets:"
- "This is [an example] [id] reference-style link."
- "Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this,\non a line by itself:"
- "[id]: http://example.com/  \"Optional Title Here\"\n\nThat is:\n\n*"
- Square brackets containing the link identifier (optionally
- "indented from the left margin using up to three spaces);\n*   followed by a colon;\n*"
- "followed by one or more spaces (or tabs);\n*   followed by the URL for the link;\n*"
- "optionally followed by a title attribute for the link, enclosed"
- "in double or single quotes, or enclosed in parentheses."
- "The following three link definitions are equivalent:"
- "[foo]: http://example.com/  \"Optional Title Here\"\n\t[foo]: http://example.com/  'Optional Title Here'"
- "[foo]: http://example.com/  (Optional Title Here)\n\n**Note:**"
- There is a known bug in Markdown.pl 1.0.1 which prevents
- single quotes from being used to delimit link titles.
- "The link URL may, optionally, be surrounded by angle brackets:"
- "[id]: <http://example.com/>  \"Optional Title Here\""
- You can put the title attribute on the next line and use extra spaces
- "or tabs for padding, which tends to look better with longer URLs:"
- "[id]: http://example.com/longish/path/to/resource/here\n        \"Optional Title Here\""
- Link definitions are only used for creating links during Markdown
- "processing, and are stripped from your document in the HTML output."
- "Link definition names may consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and\npunctuation -- but they are *not*"
- "case sensitive. E.g. these two\nlinks:\n\n\t[link text][a]\n\t[link text][A]\n\nare equivalent.\n\nThe *"
- implicit link name* shortcut allows you to omit the name of the
- "link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name."
- "Just use an empty set of square brackets -- e.g., to link the word\n\"Google\""
- "to the google.com web site, you could simply write:\n\n\t[Google][]\n\nAnd then define the link:"
- "[Google]: http://google.com/\n\nBecause link names may contain spaces, this shortcut even works for"
- "multiple words in the link text:\n\n\tVisit [Daring Fireball][] for more information."
- "And then define the link:\n\n\t[Daring Fireball]: http://daringfireball.net/"
- Link definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markdown document. I
- "tend to put them immediately after each paragraph in which they're"
- "used, but if you want, you can put them all at the end of your\ndocument, sort of like footnotes."
- "Here's an example of reference links in action:"
- "I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from\n    [Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3]."
- "[1]: http://google.com/        \"Google\"\n      [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\""
- "[3]: http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\""
- "Using the implicit link name shortcut, you could instead write:"
- "I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from\n    [Yahoo][] or [MSN][]."
- "[google]: http://google.com/        \"Google\""
- "[yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\""
- "[msn]:    http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\""
- "Both of the above examples will produce the following HTML output:"
- "<p>I get 10 times more traffic from <a href=\"http://google.com/\""
- "title=\"Google\">Google</a> than from"
- "<a href=\"http://search.yahoo.com/\" title=\"Yahoo Search\">Yahoo</a>"
- "or <a href=\"http://search.msn.com/\" title=\"MSN Search\">MSN</a>.</p>"
- "For comparison, here is the same paragraph written using\nMarkdown's inline link style:"
- "I get 10 times more traffic from [Google](http://google.com/ \"Google\")"
- "than from [Yahoo](http://search.yahoo.com/ \"Yahoo Search\") or"
- "[MSN](http://search.msn.com/ \"MSN Search\").\n\nThe point of reference-style links is not that they'"
- "re easier to\nwrite. The point is that with reference-style links, your document"
- "source is vastly more readable. Compare the above examples: using"
- "reference-style links, the paragraph itself is only 81 characters\nlong; with inline-style links, it'"
- "s 176 characters; and as raw HTML,\nit's 234 characters. In the raw HTML, there'"
- "s more markup than there\nis text.\n\nWith Markdown'"
- "s reference-style links, a source document much more"
- "closely resembles the final output, as rendered in a browser. By"
- "allowing you to move the markup-related metadata out of the paragraph,"
- "you can add links without interrupting the narrative flow of your\nprose.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"em\">Emphasis</h3>"
- "Markdown treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`"
- ") as indicators of\nemphasis. Text wrapped with one `*` or `_` will be wrapped with an\nHTML `<em>`"
- "tag; double `*`'s or `_`'s will be wrapped with an HTML\n`<strong>`"
- "tag. E.g., this input:\n\n    *single asterisks*\n\n    _single underscores_\n\n    **double asterisks**"
- "__double underscores__\n\nwill produce:\n\n    <em>single asterisks</em>"
- "<em>single underscores</em>\n\n    <strong>double asterisks</strong>"
- "<strong>double underscores</strong>"
- You can use whichever style you prefer; the lone restriction is that
- the same character must be used to open and close an emphasis span.
- "Emphasis can be used in the middle of a word:\n\n    un*frigging*believable\n\nBut if you surround an"
- "`*` or `_`"
- "with spaces, it'll be treated as a\nliteral asterisk or underscore."
- To produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it
- "would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash\nescape it:"
- "\\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\\*\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"code\">Code</h3>"
- "To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`` ` ``"
- ").\nUnlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a"
- "normal paragraph. For example:\n\n    Use the `printf()` function.\n\nwill produce:"
- "<p>Use the <code>printf()</code> function.</p>"
- "To include a literal backtick character within a code span, you can use"
- "multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters:"
- "``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``\n\nwhich will produce this:"
- "<p><code>There is a literal backtick (`) here.</code></p>"
- The backtick delimiters surrounding a code span may include spaces --
- "one after the opening, one before the closing. This allows you to place"
- "literal backtick characters at the beginning or end of a code span:"
- "A single backtick in a code span: `` ` ``\n\n\tA backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` ``"
- "will produce:\n\n\t<p>A single backtick in a code span: <code>`</code></p>"
- "<p>A backtick-delimited string in a code span: <code>`foo`</code></p>"
- "With a code span, ampersands and angle brackets are encoded as HTML"
- "entities automatically, which makes it easy to include example HTML\ntags. Markdown will turn this:"
- "Please don't use any `<blink>` tags.\n\ninto:"
- "<p>Please don't use any <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n\nYou can write this:"
- "`&#8212;` is the decimal-encoded equivalent of `&mdash;`.\n\nto produce:"
- "<p><code>&amp;#8212;</code> is the decimal-encoded\n    equivalent of <code>&amp;mdash;</code>.</p>"
- "<h3 id=\"img\">Images</h3>"
- "Admittedly, it's fairly difficult to devise a \"natural\" syntax for"
- placing images into a plain text document format.
- Markdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax
- "for links, allowing for two styles: *inline* and *reference*.\n\nInline image syntax looks like this:"
- "![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)\n\n    ![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg \"Optional title\")\n\nThat is:\n\n*"
- "An exclamation mark: `!`;\n*   followed by a set of square brackets, containing the `alt`"
- "attribute text for the image;\n*   followed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to"
- "the image, and an optional `title`"
- "attribute enclosed in double\n    or single quotes.\n\nReference-style image syntax looks like this:"
- "![Alt text][id]\n\nWhere \"id\" is the name of a defined image reference. Image references"
- "are defined using syntax identical to link references:"
- "[id]: url/to/image  \"Optional title attribute\""
- "As of this writing, Markdown has no syntax for specifying the"
- "dimensions of an image; if this is important to you, you can simply\nuse regular HTML `<img>` tags."
- "* * *"
- "<h2 id=\"misc\">Miscellaneous</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"autolink\">Automatic Links</h3>"
- "Markdown supports a shortcut style for creating \"automatic\""
- "links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets."
- "What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have"
- "it be a clickable link, you can do this:\n\n    <http://example.com/>\n\nMarkdown will turn this into:"
- "<a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://example.com/</a>"
- "Automatic links for email addresses work similarly, except that"
- Markdown will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and hex
- entity-encoding to help obscure your address from address-harvesting
- "spambots. For example, Markdown will turn this:\n\n    <address@example.com>"
- "into something like this:"
- "<a href=\"&#x6D;&#x61;i&#x6C;&#x74;&#x6F;:&#x61;&#x64;&#x64;&#x72;&#x65;"
- "&#115;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#x70;&#x6C;e&#x2E;&#99;&#111;"
- "&#109;\">&#x61;&#x64;&#x64;&#x72;&#x65;&#115;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#120;&#x61;"
- "&#109;&#x70;&#x6C;e&#x2E;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>"
- "which will render in a browser as a clickable link to \"address@example.com\"."
- "(This sort of entity-encoding trick will indeed fool many, if not"
- "most, address-harvesting bots, but it definitely won't fool all of\nthem. It'"
- "s better than nothing, but an address published in this way"
- "will probably eventually start receiving spam.)\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"backslash\">Backslash Escapes</h3>"
- Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal
- "characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown's"
- "formatting syntax. For example, if you wanted to surround a word"
- "with literal asterisks (instead of an HTML `<em>`"
- "tag), you can use\nbackslashes before the asterisks, like this:\n\n    \\*literal asterisks\\*"
- "Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:\n\n    \\   backslash"
- "`   backtick\n    *   asterisk\n    _   underscore\n    {}  curly braces\n    []  square brackets"
- "()  parentheses\n    #   hash mark\n\t+\tplus sign\n\t-\tminus sign (hyphen)\n    .   dot"
- "!   exclamation mark"
