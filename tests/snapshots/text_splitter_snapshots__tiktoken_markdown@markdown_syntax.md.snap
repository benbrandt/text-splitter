- "s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be"
- " used as a\nformat for *writing*"
- " for the web.\n\n"
- "Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even"
- " close to it. Its\n"
- "syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very"
- " small subset of\n"
- HTML tags. The idea is *not*
- " to create a syntax that makes it easier\n"
- "to insert HTML tags. "
- "In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to"
- "\n"
- "insert. "
- The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to
- " read, write, and\n"
- edit prose. HTML is a *publishing*
- " format; Markdown is a *writing*"
- "\nformat. Thus, Markdown'"
- "s formatting syntax only addresses issues that\n"
- "can be conveyed in plain text.\n\n"
- "For any markup that is not covered by Markdown's"
- " syntax, you simply\nuse HTML itself. There"
- "'s no need to preface it or delimit"
- " it to\nindicate that you'"
- re switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use
- "\nthe tags.\n\n"
- The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements --
- " e.g. `<div>`,\n"
- "`<table>`, `<pre>`, `<"
- "p>`, etc. -- must be separated from"
- " surrounding\n"
- "content by blank lines, and the start and end"
- " tags of the block should\n"
- "not be indented with tabs or spaces. "
- "Markdown is smart enough not\n"
- "to add extra (unwanted) `<p>`"
- " tags around HTML block-level tags.\n\n"
- "For example, to add an HTML table to a"
- " Markdown article:\n\n    "
- "This is a regular paragraph.\n\n    <table>\n"
- "        <tr>\n    "
- "        <td>Foo</td>\n    "
- "    </tr>\n    </table>\n\n    "
- "This is another regular paragraph.\n\n"
- Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block
- "-level\nHTML tags. E.g., you can"
- "'t use Markdown-style `*emphasis*` inside"
- " an\nHTML block.\n\nSpan-level HTML tags --"
- " e.g. `<span>`, `<cite>`"
- ", or `<del>`"
- " -- can be\n"
- "used anywhere in a Markdown paragraph, list item,"
- " or header. If you\n"
- "want, you can even use HTML tags instead of"
- " Markdown formatting; e.g. if\nyou'"
- "d prefer to use HTML `<a>` or `<"
- "img>` tags instead of Markdown's\n"
- "link or image syntax, go right ahead.\n\n"
- "Unlike block-level HTML tags, Markdown syntax *is"
- "* processed within\nspan-level tags.\n\n\n"
- "<h3 id=\"autoescape\">Automatic Escaping"
- " for Special Characters</h3>\n\n"
- "In HTML, there are two characters that demand special"
- " treatment: `<`\nand `&`"
- ". "
- "Left angle brackets are used to start tags; "
- "ampersands are\n"
- "used to denote HTML entities. "
- "If you want to use them as literal\n"
- "characters, you must escape them as entities, "
- "e.g. `&lt;`, and\n"
- "`&amp;`"
- ".\n\n"
- Ampersands in particular are bedeviling
- " for web writers. If you want to\n"
- "write about 'AT&T', you need to write"
- " '`AT&amp;T`"
- "'. You even need to\n"
- "escape ampersands within URLs. "
- "Thus, if you want to link to:\n\n    "
- "http://images.google.com/images?"
- "num=30&q=larry+bird\n\n"
- "you need to encode the URL as:\n\n    "
- "http://images.google.com/images?"
- "num=30&amp;q=larry+bird\n\n"
- "in your anchor tag `href`"
- " attribute. Needless to say, this is easy to"
- "\n"
- "forget, and is probably the single most common source"
- " of HTML validation\n"
- "errors in otherwise well-marked-up web sites.\n\n"
- "Markdown allows you to use these characters naturally, taking"
- " care of\n"
- "all the necessary escaping for you. "
- If you use an ampersand as part of
- "\n"
- "an HTML entity, it remains unchanged; otherwise it"
- " will be translated\ninto `&amp;`"
- ".\n\n"
- "So, if you want to include a copyright symbol"
- " in your article, you can write:\n\n    "
- "&copy;\n"
- "\n"
- "and Markdown will leave it alone. "
- "But if you write:\n\n    AT&T\n"
- "\nMarkdown will translate it to:\n\n    "
- "AT&amp;T\n"
- "\nSimilarly, because Markdown supports "
- "[inline HTML](#html), if you use"
- "\n"
- "angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markdown"
- " will treat them as\n"
- "such. But if you write:\n\n    "
- "4 < 5\n"
- "\nMarkdown will translate it to:\n\n    "
- "4 &lt; 5\n"
- "\n"
- "However, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle"
- " brackets and\nampersands are *always*"
- " encoded automatically. This makes it easy to use\n"
- "Markdown to write about HTML code. "
- "(As opposed to raw HTML, which is a"
- "\n"
- "terrible format for writing about HTML syntax, because"
- " every single `<`\nand `&`"
- " in your example code needs to be escaped.)\n\n\n"

- "\n\n"
- "<h2 id=\"block\">Block Elements</"
- "h2>\n\n\n"
- "<h3 id=\"p\">Paragraphs and Line"
- " Breaks</h3>\n\n"
- A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of
- " text, separated\n"
- "by one or more blank lines. "
- (A blank line is any line that looks like a
- "\nblank line --"
- " a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered"
- "\n"
- "blank.) "
- Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or
- " tabs.\n\nThe implication of the \""
- "one or more consecutive lines of text\" rule is"
- "\nthat Markdown supports \"hard-wrapped\""
- " text paragraphs. This differs\n"
- "significantly from most other text-to-HTML "
- "formatters (including Movable\nType's \""
- "Convert Line Breaks\" option) which translate every"
- " line break\ncharacter in a paragraph into a "
- "`<br />` tag.\n\nWhen you "
- "*do* want to insert a `<br />"
- "` break tag using Markdown, you\n"
- "end a line with two or more spaces, then"
- " type return.\n\n"
- "Yes, this takes a tad more effort to create"
- " a `<br />`"
- ", but a simplistic\n\""
- "every line break is a `<br />`\""
- " rule wouldn't work for Markdown.\nMarkdown'"
- "s email-style [blockquoting][bq"
- "] and multi-paragraph [list items][l"
- "]\nwork best -- and look better --"
- " when you format them with hard breaks."
- "\n\n  [bq]: #blockquote\n"
- "  [l]:  #list\n\n\n\n"
- "<h3 id=\"header\">Headers</h3"
- ">\n\nMarkdown supports two styles of headers, ["
- "Setext] [1] and [atx"
- "] [2]"
- ".\n\nSetext-style headers are \"underlined\""
- " using equal signs (for first-level\n"
- headers) and dashes (for second-level headers).
- " For example:\n\n    "
- "This is an H1\n    =============\n\n"
- "    This is an H2\n    -------------\n\n"
- "Any number of underlining `=`'s or"
- " `-`"
- "'s will work.\n\n"
- Atx-style headers use 1-6 hash
- " characters at the start of the line,\n"
- corresponding to header levels 1-6
- ". For example:\n\n    "
- "# This is an H1\n\n"
- "    ## This is an H2\n\n    "
- "###### This is an H6\n\n"
- "Optionally, you may \"close\" atx"
- "-style headers. This is purely\ncosmetic --"
- " you can use this if you think it looks better"
- ". The\nclosing hashes don'"
- "t even need to match the number of hashes\n"
- "used to open the header. "
- "(The number of opening hashes\n"
- "determines the header level.) :\n\n    "
- "# This is an H1 #\n\n"
- "    ## This is an H2 ##\n\n    "
- "### This is an H3 ######\n\n\n"
- "<h3 id=\"blockquote\">Blockquotes</"
- "h3>\n\nMarkdown uses email-style `>`"
- " characters for blockquoting. If you're\n"
- familiar with quoting passages of text in an email
- " message, then you\n"
- know how to create a blockquote in Markdown.
- " It looks best if you hard\n"
- "wrap the text and put a `>` before every"
- " line:\n\n    "
- "> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs."
- " Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n    "
- "> consectetuer adipiscing elit. "
- "Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere "
- "lectus.\n    "
- "> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra"
- " nec, fringilla in, laoreet"
- " vitae, risus.\n    >\n    "
- "> Donec sit amet nisl. "
- "Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. "
- "Suspendisse\n    "
- "> id sem consectetuer libero luctus"
- " adipiscing.\n\n"
- Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the
- " `>`"
- " before the first\n"
- "line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:\n\n    "
- "> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs."
- " Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n    "
- "consectetuer adipiscing elit. "
- "Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere "
- "lectus.\n    "
- "Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra"
- " nec, fringilla in, laoreet"
- " vitae, risus.\n\n    "
- "> Donec sit amet nisl. "
- "Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. "
- "Suspendisse\n    "
- id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing
- ".\n\n"
- Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a
- " blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by\n"
- "adding additional levels of `>`:\n\n    "
- "> This is the first level of quoting.\n"
- "    >\n    "
- "> > This is nested blockquote.\n    >\n"
- "    > Back to the first level.\n\n"
- "Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers"
- ", lists,\nand code blocks:"
- "\n\n\t> ## This is a header."
- "\n\t>\n\t>"
- " 1.   "
- "This is the first list item.\n\t>"
- " 2.   "
- This is the second list item.
- "\n\t>\n\t> Here'"
- "s some example code:\n\t>\n\t>    "
- " return shell_exec(\"echo $input | $"
- "markdown_script\");\n\n"
- Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy
- ". For\n"
- "example, with BBEdit, you can make a"
- " selection and choose Increase\n"
- "Quote Level from the Text menu.\n\n\n"
- "<h3 id=\"list\">Lists</h3"
- ">\n\n"
- Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (
- "bulleted) lists.\n\n"
- "Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses,"
- " and hyphens -- interchangably\n--"
- " as list markers:\n\n    "
- "*   Red\n    *   Green\n"
- "    *   Blue\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n    "
- "+   Red\n    +   Green\n"
- "    +   Blue\n\nand:\n\n    "
- "-   Red\n    -   Green\n"
- "    -   Blue\n\n"
- "Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:\n\n    "
- "1.  Bird\n    2.  "
- "McHale\n    "
- "3.  Parish\n\nIt'"
- s important to note that the actual numbers you use
- " to mark the\n"
- list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces
- ". The HTML\n"
- "Markdown produces from the above list is:\n\n    "
- "<ol>\n"
- "    <li>Bird</li>\n    "
- "<li>McHale</li>\n    "
- "<li>Parish</li>\n    "
- "</ol>\n\n"
- If you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this
- ":\n\n    "
- "1.  Bird\n    1.  "
- "McHale\n    "
- "1.  Parish\n\nor even:\n\n    "
- "3. Bird\n    1. "
- "McHale\n    8. Parish\n\n"
- "you'"
- "d get the exact same HTML output. "
- "The point is, if you want to,\n"
- you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists
- ", so that\n"
- the numbers in your source match the numbers in your
- " published HTML.\n"
- "But if you want to be lazy, you "
- "don't have to.\n\n"
- "If you do use lazy list numbering, however,"
- " you should still start the\n"
- "list with the number 1. "
- "At some point in the future, Markdown may support"
- "\nstarting ordered lists at an arbitrary number.\n\n"
- "List markers typically start at the left margin, but"
- " may be indented by\n"
- "up to three spaces. "
- List markers must be followed by one or more spaces
- "\nor a tab.\n\n"
- "To make lists look nice, you can wrap items"
- " with hanging indents:\n\n    "
- "*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, "
- "consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n    "
- "    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere"
- " lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,\n"
- "        viverra nec, fringilla in,"
- " laoreet vitae, risus.\n    "
- "*   Donec sit amet nisl. "
- "Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\n    "
- "    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero"
- " luctus adipiscing.\n\n"
- "But if you want to be lazy, you "
- "don't have to:\n\n    "
- "*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, "
- "consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n    "
- "Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere "
- "lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,\n"
- "    viverra nec, fringilla in,"
- " laoreet vitae, risus.\n    "
- "*   Donec sit amet nisl. "
- "Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\n    "
- "Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero "
- "luctus adipiscing.\n\n"
- "If list items are separated by blank lines, Markdown"
- " will wrap the\nitems in `<p>`"
- " tags in the HTML output. "
- "For example, this input:\n\n    "
- "*   Bird\n    *   Magic\n"
- "\nwill turn into:\n\n    "
- "<ul>\n    <li>Bird</li>\n"
- "    <li>Magic</li>\n    "
- "</ul>\n\nBut this:\n\n    "
- "*   Bird\n\n    *   Magic\n"
- "\nwill turn into:\n\n    "
- "<ul>\n"
- "    <li><p>Bird</p></"
- "li>\n    "
- "<li><p>Magic</p></li>\n"
- "    </ul>\n\n"
- List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent
- "\n"
- paragraph in a list item must be indented by
- " either 4 spaces\nor one tab:\n\n    "
- "1.  "
- "This is a list item with two paragraphs. "
- "Lorem ipsum dolor\n    "
- "    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit."
- " Aliquam hendrerit\n    "
- "    mi posuere lectus.\n\n    "
- "    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra"
- " nec, fringilla in, laoreet"
- "\n    "
- "    vitae, risus. "
- "Donec sit amet nisl. "
- "Aliquam semper ipsum\n    "
- "    sit amet velit.\n\n    "
- "2.  "
- "Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero "
- "luctus adipiscing.\n\n"
- It looks nice if you indent every line of the
- " subsequent\n"
- "paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow"
- " you to be\nlazy:\n\n    "
- "*   This is a list item with two paragraphs"
- ".\n\n    "
- "    This is the second paragraph in the list item"
- ". You're\n    "
- "only required to indent the first line. "
- "Lorem ipsum dolor\n    "
- "sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n\n    "
- "*   Another item in the same list.\n\n"
- "To put a blockquote within a list item,"
- " the blockquote's `>`"
- "\ndelimiters need to be indented:\n\n    "
- "*   A list item with a blockquote:\n\n"
- "        > This is a blockquote\n    "
- "    > inside a list item.\n\n"
- "To put a code block within a list item,"
- " the code block needs\nto be indented "
- "*twice* -- 8 spaces or two"
- " tabs:\n\n    "
- "*   A list item with a code block:\n\n"
- "            <code goes here>\n\n\nIt'"
- "s worth noting that it's possible to trigger an"
- " ordered list by\n"
- "accident, by writing something like this:\n\n    "
- "1986. What a great season.\n"
- "\nIn other words, a "
- "*number-period-space* sequence at the beginning of"
- " a\n"
- "line. "
- "To avoid this, you can backslash-escape"
- " the period:\n\n    "
- "1986\\. What a great season.\n"
- "\n\n\n"
- "<h3 id=\"precode\">Code Blocks</"
- "h3>\n\n"
- Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about
- " programming or\n"
- "markup source code. "
- "Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines\n"
- "of a code block are interpreted literally. "
- "Markdown wraps a code block\nin both "
- "`<pre>` and `<code>`"
- " tags.\n\n"
- "To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent"
- " every line of the\n"
- block by at least 4 spaces or 1
- " tab. For example, given this input:\n\n    "
- "This is a normal paragraph:\n\n"
- "        This is a code block.\n\n"
- "Markdown will generate:\n\n    "
- "<p>This is a normal paragraph:</p>\n\n"
- "    <pre><code>This is a code block"
- ".\n    </code></pre>\n\n"
- "One level of indentation -- 4 spaces or "
- "1 tab -- is removed from each\n"
- "line of the code block. "
- "For example, this:\n\n    "
- "Here is an example of AppleScript:\n\n"
- "        tell application \"Foo\"\n            beep\n    "
- "    end tell\n\nwill turn into:\n\n    "
- "<p>Here is an example of AppleScript:</"
- "p>\n\n    "
- "<pre><code>tell application \"Foo\"\n    "
- "    beep\n    end tell\n    "
- "</code></pre>\n\n"
- A code block continues until it reaches a line that
- " is not indented\n"
- "(or the end of the article).\n\n"
- "Within a code block, ampersands (`&"
- "`) and angle brackets (`<` and `>`"
- ")\n"
- "are automatically converted into HTML entities. "
- "This makes it very\n"
- easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown --
- " just paste\n"
- "it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the"
- " hassle of encoding the\n"
- "ampersands and angle brackets. "
- "For example, this:\n\n    "
- "    <div class=\"footer\">\n"
- "            &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n"
- "        </div>\n\nwill turn into:\n\n    "
- "<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"footer"
- "\"&gt;\n    "
- "    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo"
- " Corporation\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    "
- "</code></pre>\n\n"
- Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks.
- " E.g.,\n"
- asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code
- " block. This means\nit'"
- "s also easy to use Markdown to write about "
- "Markdown's own syntax.\n\n\n\n"
- "<h3 id=\"hr\">Horizontal Rules</"
- "h3>\n\n"
- "You can produce a horizontal rule tag (`<hr"
- " />`) by placing three or\n"
- "more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores"
- " on a line by themselves. If you\n"
- "wish, you may use spaces between the "
- hyphens or asterisks. Each of the

- "s fairly difficult to devise a \"natural\" syntax"

- Markdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble

- ".\n\nInline image syntax looks like this:\n\n    "
- "![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)\n\n"

- " the URL or path to\n    "
- "the image, and an optional `title` attribute"
- " enclosed in double\n    or single quotes.\n\n"

- "\nWhere \"id\""

- "Image references\n"
- "are defined using syntax identical to link references:\n\n    "
- "[id]: url/to/image  \"Optional title attribute"
- "\"\n\n"
- "As of this writing, Markdown has no syntax for"

- "<h3 id=\"autolink\">Automatic Links"
- "</h3>\n\n"
- "Markdown supports a shortcut style for creating \"automatic\""
- " links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the"
- " URL or email address with angle brackets. "
- What this means is that if you want to show
- " the actual text of a URL or email address,"
- " and also have it be a clickable link, you"
- " can do this:\n\n    "
- "<http://example.com/>\n"
- "\nMarkdown will turn this into:\n\n    "
- "<a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://"
- "example.com/</a>\n\n"
- "Automatic links for email addresses work similarly, except that"
- "\n"
- Markdown will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and
- " hex\n"
- entity-encoding to help obscure your address from address
- "-harvesting\n"
- "spambots. "
- "For example, Markdown will turn this:\n\n    "
- "<address@example.com>\n"
- "\ninto something like this:\n\n    "
- "<a href=\"&#x6D;&#x61"
- ";i&#x6C;&#x74;&#"

- "&#109;&#x70;&#x6C;"
- "e&#x2E;&#99;&#111;&#"
- "109;</a>\n\n"
- which will render in a browser as a clickable link
- " to \"address@example.com\".\n\n"

- " many, if not\n"
- "most, address-harvesting bots, but"
- " it definitely won't fool all of\n"
- "them. It'"
- "s better than nothing, but an address published in"
- " this way\nwill probably eventually start receiving spam.)\n\n\n\n"
- "<h3 id=\"backslash\">Backslash "
- "Escapes</h3>\n\n"
- Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate
- " literal\n"
- "characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown's"
- "\n"
- "formatting syntax. "
- "For example, if you wanted to surround a word"
- "\n"
- "with literal asterisks (instead of an HTML `<"
- "em>` tag), you can use\n"
- "backslashes before the asterisks, like this:"
- "\n\n    \\*literal asterisks\\*\n"
- "\n"
- "Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:"
- "\n\n    "
- "\\   backslash\n"
- "    `   backtick\n    "
- "*   asterisk\n    _   underscore\n"
