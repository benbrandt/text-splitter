- "From forth the fatal loins of these two foes\nA pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;\n"

- " [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nACT I\n\nSCENE I. A public place.\n\n"
- " Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.\n\nGREGORY.\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nI mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nI strike quickly, being moved.\n\nGREGORY.\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou\n"
- "art moved, thou runn’st away.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand.\n"
- "I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nThat shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nTrue, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to\n"
- "the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and\nthrust his maids to the wall.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\n’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the\n"
- "men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.\n\nGREGORY.\nThe heads of the maids?\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense\nthou wilt.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a\npretty piece of flesh.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\n’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.\n"
- "Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.\n\n Enter Abram and Balthasar.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\n\nGREGORY.\nHow? Turn thy back and run?\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nFear me not.\n\nGREGORY.\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to\nthem if they bear it."
- "\n\nABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON.\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\n\n"
- "ABRAM.\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON.\nIs the law of our side if I say ay?\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nNo.\n\nSAMPSON.\nNo sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.\n\n"
- "GREGORY.\nDo you quarrel, sir?\n\nABRAM.\nQuarrel, sir? No, sir.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nBut if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.\n\nABRAM.\nNo better.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nWell, sir.\n\n Enter Benvolio.\n\nGREGORY.\nSay better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nYes, better, sir.\n\nABRAM.\nYou lie.\n\n"
- "SAMPSON.\nDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.\n\n [_They fight._]\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nPart, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.\n\n [_Beats down their swords._]"
- "\n\n Enter Tybalt.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\nTurn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nI do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,\nOr manage it to part these men with me.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\n"
- "Have at thee, coward.\n\n [_They fight._]\n\n Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.\n\n"
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\n"
- "Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\n\n Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\n\n"
- " Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.\n\nMONTAGUE.\nThou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.\n\n"
- "LADY MONTAGUE.\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\n\n Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants."
- "\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—\n"
- "Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\n"
- "With purple fountains issuing from your veins,\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\n"
- "Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\n"
- "Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\n"
- "Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens\n"
- "Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\n"
- "Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\n"
- "Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\nFor this time all the rest depart away:\n"
- "You, Capulet, shall go along with me,\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,\n"
- "To know our farther pleasure in this case,\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\n"
- "Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\n Citizens and Servants._]\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nHere were the servants of your adversary\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\n"
- "I drew to part them, in the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\n"
- "Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,\n"
- "Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\n"
- "Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\n\n"
- "LADY MONTAGUE.\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,\n"
- "A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\n"
- "That westward rooteth from this city side,\nSo early walking did I see your son.\n"
- "Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\n"
- "I, measuring his affections by my own,\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\n"
- "Being one too many by my weary self,\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\n"
- "And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\n"
- "Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\n"
- "Should in the farthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\n"
- "Away from light steals home my heavy son,\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\n"
- "Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\n"
- "Black and portentous must this humour prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\n\nMONTAGUE.\nI neither know it nor can learn of him."
- "\n\nBENVOLIO.\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,\n"
- "Is to himself—I will not say how true—\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\n"
- "So far from sounding and discovery,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\n"
- "Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\n"
- "Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\n\n"
- " Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied."
- "\n\nMONTAGUE.\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nGood morrow, cousin.\n\nROMEO.\nIs the day so young?"
- "\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBut new struck nine.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nIn love?\n\nROMEO.\nOut.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nOf love?\n\nROMEO.\nOut of her favour where I am in love.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\n"
- "Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\n"
- "Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\n"
- "O anything, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\n"
- "Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\n"
- "Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\n"
- "Dost thou not laugh?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nNo coz, I rather weep.\n\nROMEO.\nGood heart, at what?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAt thy good heart’s oppression.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\n"
- "Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\n"
- "Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\n"
- "Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:\n"
- "What is it else? A madness most discreet,\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz."
- "\n\n [_Going._]\n\nBENVOLIO.\nSoft! I will go along:\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\nThis is not Romeo, he’s some other where.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\n\nROMEO.\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,\nA word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.\n"
- "In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nI aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nA right good markman, and she’s fair I love.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWell, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit\nWith Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;\n"
- "And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,\nFrom love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.\n"
- "She will not stay the siege of loving terms\nNor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,\n"
- "Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\nO she’s rich in beauty, only poor\n"
- "That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\nFor beauty starv’d with her severity,\n"
- "Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,\n"
- "To merit bliss by making me despair.\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\n"
- "Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBe rul’d by me, forget to think of her.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO teach me how I should forget to think.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\nExamine other beauties.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis the way\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\n"
- "These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;\n"
- "He that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\n"
- "Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note\n"
- "Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?\nFarewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nI’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Street.\n\n"
- " Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,\n"
- "For men so old as we to keep the peace.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nOf honourable reckoning are you both,\nAnd pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.\n"
- "But now my lord, what say you to my suit?\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nBut saying o’er what I have said before.\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world,\n"
- "She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\nLet two more summers wither in their pride\n"
- "Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\n\nPARIS.\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nAnd too soon marr’d are those so early made.\nThe earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,"
- "\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\n"
- "My will to her consent is but a part;\nAnd she agree, within her scope of choice\n"
- "Lies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustom’d feast,\n"
- "Whereto I have invited many a guest,\nSuch as I love, and you among the store,\n"
- "One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\n"
- "Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\n"
- "When well apparell’d April on the heel\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\n"
- "Among fresh female buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\n"
- "And like her most whose merit most shall be:\nWhich, on more view of many, mine, being one,\n"
- "May stand in number, though in reckoning none.\nCome, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about\n"
- "Through fair Verona; find those persons out\n"
- "Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,\n"
- "My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.\n\n [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nFind them out whose names are written here! It is written that the\n"
- "shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the\n"
- "fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to\n"
- "find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what\n"
- "names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good\ntime!\n\n"
- " Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,\nOne pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;"
- "\nTurn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\nOne desperate grief cures with another’s languish:\n"
- "Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nYour plantain leaf is excellent for that.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nFor what, I pray thee?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nFor your broken shin.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNot mad, but bound more than a madman is:\nShut up in prison, kept without my food,\n"
- "Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.\n\nSERVANT.\nGod gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?"
- "\n\nROMEO.\nAy, mine own fortune in my misery.\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nPerhaps you have learned it without book.\nBut I pray, can you read anything you see?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAy, If I know the letters and the language.\n\nSERVANT.\nYe say honestly, rest you merry!\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nStay, fellow; I can read.\n\n [_He reads the letter._]\n\n"
- "_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\nCounty Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\n"
- "The lady widow of Utruvio;\nSignior Placentio and his lovely nieces;\n"
- "Mercutio and his brother Valentine;\nMine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\n"
- "My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;\n"
- "Lucio and the lively Helena. _\n\n\nA fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?"
- "\n\nSERVANT.\nUp.\n\nROMEO.\nWhither to supper?\n\nSERVANT.\nTo our house.\n\nROMEO.\nWhose house?\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nMy master’s.\n\nROMEO.\nIndeed I should have ask’d you that before.\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nNow I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,\n"
- "and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a\ncup of wine. Rest you merry.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAt this same ancient feast of Capulet’s\nSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;\n"
- "With all the admired beauties of Verona.\nGo thither and with unattainted eye,\n"
- "Compare her face with some that I shall show,\nAnd I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhen the devout religion of mine eye\nMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;\n"
- "And these who, often drown’d, could never die,\nTransparent heretics, be burnt for liars.\n"
- "One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\nNe’er saw her match since first the world begun.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,\nHerself pois’d with herself in either eye:\n"
- "But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d\nYour lady’s love against some other maid\n"
- "That I will show you shining at this feast,\nAnd she shall scant show well that now shows best.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,\nBut to rejoice in splendour of my own.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nNurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nNow, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,\nI bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!\n"
- "God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\nJULIET.\nHow now, who calls?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nYour mother.\n\nJULIET.\nMadam, I am here. What is your will?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThis is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,\n"
- "We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,\nI have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.\n"
- "Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.\n\nNURSE.\nFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nShe’s not fourteen.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nI’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,\nAnd yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,\n"
- "She is not fourteen. How long is it now\nTo Lammas-tide?\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nA fortnight and odd days.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,\nCome Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\n"
- "Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—\nWere of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\n"
- "She was too good for me. But as I said,\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\n"
- "That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\n’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\n"
- "And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day:\n"
- "For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;\n"
- "My lord and you were then at Mantua:\nNay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,\n"
- "When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\n"
- "To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!\nShake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,\n"
- "To bid me trudge.\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;\n"
- "For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\n"
- "For even the day before she broke her brow,\nAnd then my husband,—God be with his soul!\n"
- "A was a merry man,—took up the child:\n‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?\n"
- "Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,\n"
- "The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.\nTo see now how a jest shall come about.\n"
- "I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,\n"
- "I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;\n"
- "And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,\nTo think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;\n"
- "And yet I warrant it had upon it brow\nA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;\n"
- "A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\n‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?\n"
- "Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nPeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace\n"
- "Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:\n"
- "And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nMarry, that marry is the very theme\nI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\n"
- "How stands your disposition to be married?\n\nJULIET.\nIt is an honour that I dream not of.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAn honour! Were not I thine only nurse,\nI would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, think of marriage now: younger than you,\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\n"
- "Are made already mothers. By my count\nI was your mother much upon these years\n"
- "That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nA man, young lady! Lady, such a man\nAs all the world—why he’s a man of wax.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nVerona’s summer hath not such a flower.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nNay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhat say you, can you love the gentleman?\n"
- "This night you shall behold him at our feast;\nRead o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,\n"
- "And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.\nExamine every married lineament,\n"
- "And see how one another lends content;\nAnd what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,\n"
- "Find written in the margent of his eyes.\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,\n"
- "To beautify him, only lacks a cover:\nThe fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride\n"
- "For fair without the fair within to hide.\nThat book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,\n"
- "That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess,\n"
- "By having him, making yourself no less.\n\nNURSE.\nNo less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI’ll look to like, if looking liking move:\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\n"
- "Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\n\n Enter a Servant.\n\n"
- "SERVANT.\nMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady\n"
- "asked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.\n"
- "I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nWe follow thee.\n\n"
- " [_Exit Servant._]\n\nJuliet, the County stays.\n\nNURSE.\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Street.\n\n"
- " Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;\n Torch-bearers and others.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\nOr shall we on without apology?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThe date is out of such prolixity:\nWe’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,\n"
- "Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,\nScaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;\n"
- "Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\nAfter the prompter, for our entrance:\n"
- "But let them measure us by what they will,\nWe’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGive me a torch, I am not for this ambling;\nBeing but heavy I will bear the light.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNot I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,\nWith nimble soles, I have a soul of lead\n"
- "So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nYou are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,\nAnd soar with them above a common bound.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\nTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound,\n"
- "I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\nUnder love’s heavy burden do I sink.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,\nToo rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn."
- "\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;\n"
- "Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\n"
- "Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]\nA visor for a visor. What care I\n"
- "What curious eye doth quote deformities?\nHere are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nA torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\n"
- "For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,\nI’ll be a candle-holder and look on,\n"
- "The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nTut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:\n"
- "If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire\nOr save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest\n"
- "Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.\n\nROMEO.\nNay, that’s not so.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nI mean sir, in delay\nWe waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.\n"
- "Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\nBut ’tis no wit to go.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nWhy, may one ask?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nAnd so did I.\n\nROMEO.\nWell what was yours?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThat dreamers often lie.\n\nROMEO.\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes\n"
- "In shape no bigger than an agate-stone\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\n"
- "Drawn with a team of little atomies\nOver men’s noses as they lie asleep:\n"
- "Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\n"
- "Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;\nThe collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;\n"
- "Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;\nHer waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\n"
- "Not half so big as a round little worm\nPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:\n"
- "Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\n"
- "Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\n"
- "Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;\n"
- "O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;\n"
- "O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;\nO’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,\n"
- "Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\n"
- "Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\n"
- "And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,\nTickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,\n"
- "Then dreams he of another benefice:\nSometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,\n"
- "And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,\n"
- "Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;\n"
- "And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\n"
- "That plats the manes of horses in the night;\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,\n"
- "Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\n"
- "That presses them, and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage:\nThis is she,—"
- "\n\nROMEO.\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,\nThou talk’st of nothing.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\n"
- "Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\n"
- "And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,\n"
- "And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his side to the dew-dropping south.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late."
- "\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars,\n"
- "Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night’s revels; and expire the term\n"
- "Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\n"
- "But he that hath the steerage of my course\nDirect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nStrike, drum.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.\n\n"
- " Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.\n\n"
- "FIRST SERVANT.\nWhere’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?\n"
- "He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!\n\n"
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nWhen good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they\n"
- "unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.\n\n"
- "FIRST SERVANT.\nAway with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the\n"
- "plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,\n"
- "let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan!\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nAy, boy, ready."
- "\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nYou are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the\ngreat chamber."
- "\n\n"
- "SECOND SERVANT.\nWe cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and\n"
- "the longer liver take all.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n"
- " Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWelcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes\n"
- "Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.\nAh my mistresses, which of you all\n"
- "Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,\nShe I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?\n"
- "Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\nThat I have worn a visor, and could tell\n"
- "A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,\nSuch as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,\n"
- "You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.\nA hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls.\n\n"
- " [_Music plays, and they dance._]\n\n"
- "More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,\nAnd quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.\n"
- "Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.\nNay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,\n"
- "For you and I are past our dancing days;\nHow long is’t now since last yourself and I\nWere in a mask?"
- "\n\nCAPULET’S COUSIN.\nBy’r Lady, thirty years.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWhat, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:\n’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,\n"
- "Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,\nSome five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.\n\n"
- "CAPULET’S COUSIN.\n’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;\nHis son is thirty.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWill you tell me that?\nHis son was but a ward two years ago.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat lady is that, which doth enrich the hand\nOf yonder knight?\n\nSERVANT.\nI know not, sir.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\nIt seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\n"
- "As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;\nBeauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\n"
- "So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\nAs yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.\n"
- "The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,\nAnd touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\n"
- "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\nFor I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nThis by his voice, should be a Montague.\nFetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave\n"
- "Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,\nTo fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\n"
- "Now by the stock and honour of my kin,\nTo strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWhy how now, kinsman!\nWherefore storm you so?\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nUncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\nA villain that is hither come in spite,\n"
- "To scorn at our solemnity this night.\n\nCAPULET.\nYoung Romeo, is it?\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\n’Tis he, that villain Romeo.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nContent thee, gentle coz, let him alone,\nA bears him like a portly gentleman;\n"
- "And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\nTo be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.\n"
- "I would not for the wealth of all the town\nHere in my house do him disparagement.\n"
- "Therefore be patient, take no note of him,\nIt is my will; the which if thou respect,\n"
- "Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\nAn ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nIt fits when such a villain is a guest:\nI’ll not endure him.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nHe shall be endur’d.\nWhat, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;\n"
- "Am I the master here, or you? Go to.\nYou’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,\n"
- "You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!\nYou will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nWhy, uncle, ’tis a shame.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nGo to, go to!\nYou are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?\n"
- "This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.\nYou must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.\n"
- "Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:\nBe quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!\n"
- "I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nPatience perforce with wilful choler meeting\n"
- "Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\nI will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,\n"
- "Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\n[_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest hand\n"
- "This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,\nMy lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\n"
- "To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nGood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this;\n"
- "For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nHave not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAy, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:\n"
- "They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nSaints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThen move not while my prayer’s effect I take.\nThus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d.\n"
- "[_Kissing her._]\n\nJULIET.\nThen have my lips the sin that they have took.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nSin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!\nGive me my sin again.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nYou kiss by the book.\n\nNURSE.\nMadam, your mother craves a word with you.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat is her mother?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nMarry, bachelor,\nHer mother is the lady of the house,\n"
- "And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.\nI nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal.\n"
- "I tell you, he that can lay hold of her\nShall have the chinks.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIs she a Capulet?\nO dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAway, be gone; the sport is at the best.\n\nROMEO.\nAy, so I fear; the more is my unrest.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nNay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,\nWe have a trifling foolish banquet towards.\n"
- "Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;\nI thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.\n"
- "More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed.\nAh, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,\n"
- "I’ll to my rest.\n\n [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nCome hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?\n\nNURSE.\nThe son and heir of old Tiberio.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat’s he that now is going out of door?\n\nNURSE.\nMarry, that I think be young Petruchio.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat’s he that follows here, that would not dance?\n\nNURSE.\nI know not.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nGo ask his name. If he be married,\nMy grave is like to be my wedding bed.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nHis name is Romeo, and a Montague,\nThe only son of your great enemy.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nMy only love sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!\n"
- "Prodigious birth of love it is to me,\nThat I must love a loathed enemy.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nWhat’s this? What’s this?\n\nJULIET.\nA rhyme I learn’d even now\nOf one I danc’d withal.\n\n"
- " [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]\n\nNURSE.\nAnon, anon!\nCome let’s away, the strangers all are gone.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n Enter Chorus.\n\n"
- "CHORUS.\nNow old desire doth in his deathbed lie,\nAnd young affection gapes to be his heir;\n"
- "That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,\nWith tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair.\n"
- "Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,\nAlike bewitched by the charm of looks;\n"
- "But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,\nAnd she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:\n"
- "Being held a foe, he may not have access\nTo breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;\n"
- "And she as much in love, her means much less\nTo meet her new beloved anywhere.\n"
- "But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,\nTempering extremities with extreme sweet.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE I. An open place adjoining Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nCan I go forward when my heart is here?\nTurn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.\n\n"
- " [_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]\n\n Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nRomeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nHe is wise,\nAnd on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nHe ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:\nCall, good Mercutio.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, I’ll conjure too.\nRomeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover!\n"
- "Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,\nSpeak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;\n"
- "Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;\nSpeak to my gossip Venus one fair word,\n"
- "One nickname for her purblind son and heir,\nYoung Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim\n"
- "When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.\nHe heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;\n"
- "The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.\nI conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,\n"
- "By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,\nBy her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,\n"
- "And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,\nThat in thy likeness thou appear to us.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAn if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThis cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him\nTo raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,\n"
- "Of some strange nature, letting it there stand\nTill she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;\n"
- "That were some spite. My invocation\nIs fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,\n"
- "I conjure only but to raise up him.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nCome, he hath hid himself among these trees\nTo be consorted with the humorous night.\n"
- "Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nIf love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.\nNow will he sit under a medlar tree,\n"
- "And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit\nAs maids call medlars when they laugh alone.\n"
- "O Romeo, that she were, O that she were\nAn open-arse and thou a poperin pear!\n"
- "Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.\nThis field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.\n"
- "Come, shall we go?\n\nBENVOLIO.\nGo then; for ’tis in vain\nTo seek him here that means not to be found."
- "\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nHe jests at scars that never felt a wound.\n\n Juliet appears above at a window.\n\n"
- "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the east, and Juliet is the sun!\n"
- "Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief,\n"
- "That thou her maid art far more fair than she.\nBe not her maid since she is envious;\n"
- "Her vestal livery is but sick and green,\nAnd none but fools do wear it; cast it off.\n"
- "It is my lady, O it is my love!\nO, that she knew she were!\n"
- "She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\nHer eye discourses, I will answer it.\n"
- "I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\n"
- "Having some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\n"
- "What if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,\n"
- "As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\n"
- "That birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand.\n"
- "O that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek.\n\nJULIET.\nAy me.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nShe speaks.\nO speak again bright angel, for thou art\n"
- "As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven\n"
- "Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n"
- "When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name.\n"
- "Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I’ll no longer be a Capulet.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\n[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\n’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\n"
- "What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\n"
- "Belonging to a man. O be some other name.\nWhat’s in a name? That which we call a rose\n"
- "By any other name would smell as sweet;\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,\n"
- "Retain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\n"
- "And for thy name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI take thee at thy word.\nCall me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;\n"
- "Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBy a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\n"
- "Because it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\nOf thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.\n"
- "Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\n\nROMEO.\nNeither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nHow cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\n"
- "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\n"
- "If any of my kinsmen find thee here.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWith love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\n"
- "And what love can do, that dares love attempt:\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,\n"
- "And I am proof against their enmity.\n\nJULIET.\nI would not for the world they saw thee here.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here."
- "\nMy life were better ended by their hate\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nBy whose direction found’st thou out this place?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBy love, that first did prompt me to enquire;\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\n"
- "I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far\nAs that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,\n"
- "I should adventure for such merchandise.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\n"
- "For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.\nFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\n"
- "What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.\nDost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,\n"
- "And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,\n"
- "They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\n"
- "Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,\n"
- "So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;\n"
- "And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:\nBut trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true\n"
- "Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\n"
- "But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,\nMy true-love passion; therefore pardon me,\n"
- "And not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\n"
- "Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\n\nROMEO.\nWhat shall I swear by?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nDo not swear at all.\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\n"
- "Which is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I’ll believe thee.\n\nROMEO.\nIf my heart’s dear love,—\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract tonight;\n"
- "It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\n"
- "Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.\nThis bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,\n"
- "May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\nGood night, good night. As sweet repose and rest\n"
- "Come to thy heart as that within my breast.\n\nROMEO.\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have;\n"
- "My bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\n"
- "The more I have, for both are infinite.\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.\n"

- "Too flattering sweet to be substantial.\n\n Enter Juliet above.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\n"
- "Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,\nBy one that I’ll procure to come to thee,\n"
- "Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay\n"

- "Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\n"
- "And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\nWith repetition of my Romeo’s name.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name.\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,\n"
- "Like softest music to attending ears.\n\nJULIET.\nRomeo.\n\nROMEO.\nMy nyas?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat o’clock tomorrow\nShall I send to thee?\n\nROMEO.\nBy the hour of nine.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nLet me stand here till thou remember it.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRemembering how I love thy company.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAnd I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\nForgetting any other home but this.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\n’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,\n"
- "That lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\n"
- "And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI would I were thy bird.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nSweet, so would I:\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\n"
- "Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow."
- "\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.\n"
- "Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.\nThe grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,\n"
- "Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;\nAnd darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels\n"
- "From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheels\nHence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,\n"
- "His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\n\n"

- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,\n"
- "The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,\nI must upfill this osier cage of ours\n"
- "With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\nThe earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;\n"
- "What is her burying grave, that is her womb:\nAnd from her womb children of divers kind\n"
- "We sucking on her natural bosom find.\nMany for many virtues excellent,\n"
- "None but for some, and yet all different.\nO, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\n"
- "In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.\nFor naught so vile that on the earth doth live\n"
- "But to the earth some special good doth give;\nNor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,\n"
- "Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\nVirtue itself turns vice being misapplied,\n"
- "And vice sometime’s by action dignified.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "Within the infant rind of this weak flower\nPoison hath residence, and medicine power:\n"
- "For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\n"
- "Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\nTwo such opposed kings encamp them still\n"
- "In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;\nAnd where the worser is predominant,\n"
- "Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.\n\nROMEO.\nGood morrow, father.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBenedicite!\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\n"
- "Young son, it argues a distemper’d head\nSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\n"
- "Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,\nAnd where care lodges sleep will never lie;\n"
- "But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain\nDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\n"
- "Therefore thy earliness doth me assure\nThou art uprous’d with some distemperature;\n"
- "Or if not so, then here I hit it right,\nOur Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\nI have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThat’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\n"
- "Where on a sudden one hath wounded me\nThat’s by me wounded. Both our remedies\n"
- "Within thy help and holy physic lies.\nI bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,\n"
- "My intercession likewise steads my foe.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;\n"
- "Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThen plainly know my heart’s dear love is set\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet.\n"
- "As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\nAnd all combin’d, save what thou must combine\n"
- "By holy marriage. When, and where, and how\nWe met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,\n"
- "I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\nThat thou consent to marry us today.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHoly Saint Francis! What a change is here!\n"
- "Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\nSo soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies\n"
- "Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\n"
- "Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\n"
- "To season love, that of it doth not taste.\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\n"
- "Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\n"
- "Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\n"
- "Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\nAnd art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,\n"
- "Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.\n\nROMEO.\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\n\nROMEO.\nAnd bad’st me bury love.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNot in a grave\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\n"
- "The other did not so.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, she knew well\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\n"
- "But come young waverer, come go with me,\nIn one respect I’ll thy assistant be;\n"
- "For this alliance may so happy prove,\nTo turn your households’ rancour to pure love.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE IV. A Street.\n\n"
- " Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so\n"
- "that he will sure run mad.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s\nhouse.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nA challenge, on my life.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nRomeo will answer it.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nAny man that can write may answer a letter.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nNay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nAlas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black\n"
- "eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart\n"
- "cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter\nTybalt?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\n"
- "compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\n"
- "and proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\n"
- "your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\n"
- "a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,\n"
- "the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nThe what?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners\n"
- "of accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\n"
- "whore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should\n"
- "be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,\n"
- "these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot\n"
- "sit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\n"
- "fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to\n"
- "his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to\n"
- "berhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings\n"
- "and harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\n"
- "Romeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You\n"
- "gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\n"
- "mine a man may strain courtesy.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThat’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\nin the hams.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nMeaning, to curtsy.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nA most courteous exposition.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nPink for flower.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nRight.\n\nROMEO.\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,\n"
- "that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\nwearing, solely singular.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast\n"
- "more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my\n"
- "whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\ngoose.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\n\nROMEO.\nNay, good goose, bite not.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nO here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\nell broad.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves\n"
- "thee far and wide a broad goose.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou\n"
- "sociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as\n"
- "well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\n"
- "that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nStop there, stop there.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\n"
- "whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\nlonger.\n\n Enter Nurse and Peter."
- "\n\nROMEO.\nHere’s goodly gear!\nA sail, a sail!\n\nMERCUTIO.\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nPeter!\n\nPETER.\nAnon.\n\nNURSE.\nMy fan, Peter.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nIs it good-den?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\nprick of noon.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\n"
- "can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\n"
- "than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\nfault of a worse.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nYou say well.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nShe will endite him to some supper.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat hast thou found?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\n"
- "stale and hoar ere it be spent.\n[_Sings._]\n    An old hare hoar,\n    And an old hare hoar,\n"
- "  Is very good meat in Lent;\n    But a hare that is hoar\n    Is too much for a score\n"
- "  When it hoars ere it be spent.\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI will follow you.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\nropery?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\n"
- "more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\n"
- "than he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\n"
- "that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\n"
- "his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\nuse me at his pleasure!\n\n"
- "PETER.\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\n"
- "quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\n"
- "man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\n"
- "knave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\n"
- "enquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\n"
- "let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\n"
- "say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\n"
- "gentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\n"
- "her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\nvery weak dealing.\n\n"
- "ROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\nthee,—\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\nbe a joyful woman.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\ngentlemanlike offer.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\n"
- "And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\n\nROMEO.\nGo to; I say you shall.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\n"
- "And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\n"
- "Must be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\n"
- "Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.\n\nNURSE.\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\n"
- "little prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\n"
- "would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\n"
- "toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\n"
- "Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\n"
- "looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\n"
- "Romeo begin both with a letter?\n\nROMEO.\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\n"
- "with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\n"
- "of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\n\nROMEO.\nCommend me to thy lady.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\n\n [_Exit Romeo._]\n\nPETER.\nAnon.\n\nNURSE.\nBefore and apace.\n\n"

- "JULIET.\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\n"
- "Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,\n"
- "Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\n"
- "Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\n"
- "Now is the sun upon the highmost hill\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve\n"
- "Is three long hours, yet she is not come.\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\n"
- "She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me.\n"
- "But old folks, many feign as they were dead;\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\n\n"
- " Enter Nurse and Peter.\n\n"
- "O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nPeter, stay at the gate.\n\n [_Exit Peter._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNow, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?\n"
- "Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\nIf good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news\n"
- "By playing it to me with so sour a face.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\n"
- "Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nJesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am\nout of breath?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\n"
- "The excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\n"
- "Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\n"
- "Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\n"
- "Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\n"
- "leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\n"
- "they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\n"

- "ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\n"
- "My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\n"

- "JULIET.\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\n"
- "Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\n"
- "And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest.\n"
- "‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\n‘Where is your mother?’\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nO God’s lady dear,\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.\n"
- "Is this the poultice for my aching bones?\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\n\n"

- "Hie you to church. I must another way,\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love\n"
- "Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.\nI am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\n"
- "But you shall bear the burden soon at night.\nGo. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\n\n"

- "\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\n"
- "That one short minute gives me in her sight.\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\n"
- "Then love-devouring death do what he dare,\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\n"
- "And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\n"
- "Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\n"
- "Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\n\n"
- " Enter Juliet.\n\n"
- "Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\n"
- "A lover may bestride the gossamers\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\n"
- "And yet not fall; so light is vanity.\n\nJULIET.\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\n"
- "To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\n"
- "Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\n"
- "They are but beggars that can count their worth;\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\n"
- "I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\n"
- "For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\n\n [_Exeunt._]"
- "\n\n\n\nACT III\n\nSCENE I. A public Place.\n\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\n"
- "And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\n"
- "a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no\n"
- "need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\n"
- "drawer, when indeed there is no need.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAm I like such a fellow?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as\n"
- "soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nAnd what to?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would\n"
- "kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\n"
- "hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\n"
- "with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\n"
- "hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\n"
- "Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\n"
- "head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\n"
- "quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\n"
- "wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\n"
- "out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\n"
- "another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\ntutor me from quarrelling!\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\n"
- "simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nThe fee simple! O simple!\n\n"
- " Enter Tybalt and others.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nBy my heel, I care not.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\nword and a blow.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\noccasion.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\n"
- "us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\n"
- "that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\n"
- "And reason coldly of your grievances,\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\n"
- "I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\n"
- "Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\n"
- "To such a greeting. Villain am I none;\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\n"
- "Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\n"
- "As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\n"
- "Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\n\nTYBALT.\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\n"
- "make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\n"
- "of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\n"
- "Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\n\nTYBALT.\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\n\nMERCUTIO.\nCome, sir, your passado.\n\n [_They fight._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\n"
- "Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\n"
- "Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\n\n [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nI am hurt.\nA plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.\nIs he gone, and hath nothing?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nWhat, art thou hurt?\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.\n"
- "Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\n\n [_Exit Page._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\n"
- "enough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\n"
- "grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\n"
- "your houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\n"
- "death. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\n"
- "arithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\narm.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI thought all for the best.\n\n"
- "MERCUTIO.\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\n"
- "They have made worms’ meat of me.\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\n"
- "In my behalf; my reputation stain’d\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\n"
- "Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,\nThy beauty hath made me effeminate\n"
- "And in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.\n\n Re-enter Benvolio.\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,\nThat gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,\n"
- "Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThis day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;\nThis but begins the woe others must end.\n\n"
- " Re-enter Tybalt.\n\nBENVOLIO.\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAgain in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\nAway to heaven respective lenity,\n"
- "And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!\nNow, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again\n"
- "That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul\nIs but a little way above our heads,\n"
- "Staying for thine to keep him company.\nEither thou or I, or both, must go with him.\n\n"
- "TYBALT.\nThou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\nShalt with him hence.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThis shall determine that.\n\n [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nRomeo, away, be gone!\nThe citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\n"
- "Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death\nIf thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO, I am fortune’s fool!\n\nBENVOLIO.\nWhy dost thou stay?\n\n [_Exit Romeo._]\n\n Enter Citizens.\n\n"
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nWhich way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?\nTybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nThere lies that Tybalt.\n\n"
- "FIRST CITIZEN.\nUp, sir, go with me.\nI charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.\n\n"
- " Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nO noble Prince, I can discover all\nThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.\n"
- "There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\nThat slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nTybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!\nO Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d\n"
- "Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\nFor blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\n"
- "O cousin, cousin.\n\nPRINCE.\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?\n\n"
- "BENVOLIO.\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;\n"
- "Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal\n"
- "Your high displeasure. All this uttered\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\n"
- "Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\n"
- "With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\n"
- "And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\n"
- "It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\n"
- "‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\n"
- "His agile arm beats down their fatal points,\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\n"
- "An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\n"
- "But by and by comes back to Romeo,\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\n"
- "And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\n"
- "And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\n"
- "Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\n"
- "I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\n"
- "His fault concludes but what the law should end,\nThe life of Tybalt.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nAnd for that offence\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\n"
- "I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\n"
- "But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\n"
- "I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\n"
- "Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\n"
- "Bear hence this body, and attend our will.\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\n\n"
- " [_Exeunt._]\n\nSCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,\nTowards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner\n"
- "As Phaeton would whip you to the west\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.\n"
- "Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\nThat runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo\n"
- "Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites\n"
- "By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\n"
- "Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match,\n"
- "Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\nHood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,\n"
- "With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\n"
- "Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\n"
- "Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.\nCome gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,\n"
- "Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\n"
- "And he will make the face of heaven so fine\nThat all the world will be in love with night,\n"
- "And pay no worship to the garish sun.\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love,\n"
- "But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,\nNot yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day\n"
- "As is the night before some festival\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes\n"
- "And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,\nAnd she brings news, and every tongue that speaks\n"
- "But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.\n\n Enter Nurse, with cords.\n\n"
- "Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?\nThe cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAy, ay, the cords.\n\n [_Throws them down._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAy me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAh, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!\nWe are undone, lady, we are undone.\n"
- "Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.\n\nJULIET.\nCan heaven be so envious?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nRomeo can,\nThough heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.\nWho ever would have thought it? Romeo!\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?\n"
- "This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.\nHath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,\n"
- "And that bare vowel I shall poison more\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\n"
- "I am not I if there be such an I;\nOr those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.\n"
- "If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.\nBrief sounds determine of my weal or woe.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\nGod save the mark!—here on his manly breast.\n"
- "A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,\n"
- "All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.\nTo prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.\n"
- "Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nO Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.\nO courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!\n"
- "That ever I should live to see thee dead.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?\nIs Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?\n"
- "My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?\nThen dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,\n"
- "For who is living, if those two are gone?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nTybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,\nRomeo that kill’d him, he is banished.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?\n\nNURSE.\nIt did, it did; alas the day, it did.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!\nDid ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\n"
- "Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,\nDove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!\n"
- "Despised substance of divinest show!\nJust opposite to what thou justly seem’st,\n"
- "A damned saint, an honourable villain!\nO nature, what hadst thou to do in hell\n"
- "When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\nIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?\n"
- "Was ever book containing such vile matter\nSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell\n"
- "In such a gorgeous palace.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nThere’s no trust,\nNo faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,\n"
- "All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.\nAh, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.\n"
- "These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.\nShame come to Romeo.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nBlister’d be thy tongue\nFor such a wish! He was not born to shame.\n"
- "Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;\nFor ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d\n"
- "Sole monarch of the universal earth.\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nWill you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\n"
- "Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,\nWhen I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?\n"
- "But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\nThat villain cousin would have kill’d my husband."
- "\nBack, foolish tears, back to your native spring,\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,\n"
- "Which you mistaking offer up to joy.\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,\n"
- "And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.\nAll this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?\n"
- "Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,\nThat murder’d me. I would forget it fain,\n"
- "But O, it presses to my memory\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.\n"
- "Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.\nThat ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’\n"
- "Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there.\n"
- "Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,\nAnd needly will be rank’d with other griefs,\n"
- "Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,\nThy father or thy mother, nay or both,\n"
- "Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?\nBut with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,\n"
- "‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\n"
- "All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\n"
- "In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.\nWhere is my father and my mother, Nurse?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nWeeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.\nWill you go to them? I will bring you thither.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,\n"
- "When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.\nTake up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,\n"
- "Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.\nHe made you for a highway to my bed,\n"
- "But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\nCome cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,\n"
- "And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nHie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo\nTo comfort you. I wot well where he is.\n"
- "Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.\nI’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO find him, give this ring to my true knight,\nAnd bid him come to take his last farewell.\n\n"

- "Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts\nAnd thou art wedded to calamity.\n\n Enter Romeo.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nFather, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,\n"
- "That I yet know not?\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nToo familiar\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\n"
- "I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.\n\nROMEO.\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nA gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,\nNot body’s death, but body’s banishment."
- "\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\n"
- "Much more than death. Do not say banishment.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\n"
- "Hence banished is banish’d from the world,\nAnd world’s exile is death. Then banished\n"
- "Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\nThou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,\n"
- "And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\n"
- "Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\nTaking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,\n"
- "And turn’d that black word death to banishment.\nThis is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\n"
- "And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\n"
- "But Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\n"
- "In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,\n"
- "And steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty\n"
- "Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished.\n"
- "This may flies do, when I from this must fly.\nThey are free men but I am banished.\n"
- "And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\n"
- "No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?\n"
- "O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\nHowlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,\n"
- "Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\n"
- "To mangle me with that word banished?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\n"
- "To comfort thee, though thou art banished.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nYet banished? Hang up philosophy.\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\n"
- "Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,\nIt helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, then I see that mad men have no ears.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\n"
- "An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\n"
- "Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\nAnd fall upon the ground as I do now,\n"
- "Taking the measure of an unmade grave.\n\n [_Knocking within._]\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nArise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nNot I, unless the breath of heartsick groans\nMist-like infold me from the search of eyes.\n\n"
- " [_Knocking._]\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,\n"
- "Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.\n\n [_Knocking._]\n\n"
- "Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,\nWhat simpleness is this.—I come, I come.\n\n [_Knocking._]\n\n"
- "Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\n[_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\nI come from Lady Juliet.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWelcome then.\n\n Enter Nurse.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nO holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,\nWhere is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?\n\n"

- "NURSE.\nO, he is even in my mistress’ case.\nJust in her case! O woeful sympathy!\n"
- "Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,\nBlubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\n"
- "Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.\nFor Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.\n"
- "Why should you fall into so deep an O?\n\nROMEO.\nNurse.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nAh sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\nDoth not she think me an old murderer,\n"
- "Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy\nWith blood remov’d but little from her own?\n"
- "Where is she? And how doth she? And what says\nMy conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\n"
- "And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAs if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\n"
- "Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand\nMurder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,\n"
- "In what vile part of this anatomy\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\nThe hateful mansion."

- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold thy desperate hand.\nArt thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.\n"
- "Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast.\n"
- "Unseemly woman in a seeming man,\nAnd ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\n"
- "Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,\nI thought thy disposition better temper’d.\n"
- "Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\nAnd slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,\n"
- "By doing damned hate upon thyself?\nWhy rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?\n"
- "Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet\n"
- "In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\n"
- "Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\nWhich, like a usurer, abound’st in all,\n"
- "And usest none in that true use indeed\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\n"
- "Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\n"
- "Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\nKilling that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;\n"
- "Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\n"
- "Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\n"
- "And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.\nWhat, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,\n"
- "For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\n"

- "Happiness courts thee in her best array;\nBut like a misshaped and sullen wench,\n"

- "NURSE.\nO Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night\nTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\n"
- "My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.\n\nROMEO.\nDo so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nHere sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.\nHie you, make haste, for it grows very late.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\nROMEO.\nHow well my comfort is reviv’d by this.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nGo hence, good night, and here stands all your state:\n"
- "Either be gone before the watch be set,\nOr by the break of day disguis’d from hence.\n"
- "Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,\nAnd he shall signify from time to time\n"
- "Every good hap to you that chances here.\nGive me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nBut that a joy past joy calls out on me,\nIt were a grief so brief to part with thee.\n"

- " Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nThings have fallen out, sir, so unluckily\nThat we have had no time to move our daughter.\n"
- "Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\nAnd so did I. Well, we were born to die.\n"
- "’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.\nI promise you, but for your company,\n"
- "I would have been abed an hour ago.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nThese times of woe afford no tune to woo.\nMadam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nI will, and know her mind early tomorrow;\nTonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nSir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\nOf my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d\n"
- "In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\nWife, go you to her ere you go to bed,\n"
- "Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,\nAnd bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,\n"
- "But, soft, what day is this?\n\nPARIS.\nMonday, my lord.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nMonday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,\nA Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,\n"
- "She shall be married to this noble earl.\nWill you be ready? Do you like this haste?\n"
- "We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,\nFor, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\n"
- "It may be thought we held him carelessly,\nBeing our kinsman, if we revel much.\n"
- "Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,\nAnd there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nMy lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWell, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\nGo you to Juliet ere you go to bed,\n"
- "Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\nFarewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!\n"
- "Afore me, it is so very very late that we\nMay call it early by and by. Good night.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n"
- "SCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden.\n\n Enter Romeo and Juliet.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\n"
- "That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;\nNightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\n"
- "Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,\nNo nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\n"
- "Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.\nNight’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\n"
- "Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nYond light is not daylight, I know it, I.\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhales\n"
- "To be to thee this night a torchbearer\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua.\n"
- "Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nLet me be ta’en, let me be put to death,\nI am content, so thou wilt have it so.\n"
- "I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,\n’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.\n"
- "Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\nThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\n"
- "I have more care to stay than will to go.\nCome, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.\n"
- "How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIt is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\n"
- "Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\nSome say the lark makes sweet division;\n"
- "This doth not so, for she divideth us.\nSome say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.\n"
- "O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\n"
- "Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.\nO now be gone, more light and light it grows.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nMore light and light, more dark and dark our woes.\n\n Enter Nurse.\n\nNURSE.\nMadam.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNurse?\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nYour lady mother is coming to your chamber.\nThe day is broke, be wary, look about.\n\n"
- " [_Exit._]\n\nJULIET.\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nFarewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.\n\n [_Descends._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nArt thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,\n"
- "I must hear from thee every day in the hour,\nFor in a minute there are many days.\n"
- "O, by this count I shall be much in years\nEre I again behold my Romeo.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nFarewell!\nI will omit no opportunity\nThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nI doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve\nFor sweet discourses in our time to come.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO God! I have an ill-divining soul!\nMethinks I see thee, now thou art so low,\n"
- "As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\nEither my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.\n\n"
- "ROMEO.\nAnd trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\nDry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.\n\n"
- " [_Exit below._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,\nIf thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\n"
- "That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;\nFor then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long\n"
- "But send him back.\n\nLADY CAPULET.\n[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWho is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?\nIs she not down so late, or up so early?\n"
- "What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?\n\n Enter Lady Capulet.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWhy, how now, Juliet?\n\nJULIET.\nMadam, I am not well.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nEvermore weeping for your cousin’s death?\n"
- "What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\n"
- "And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\n"
- "Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,\nBut much of grief shows still some want of wit."
- "\n\nJULIET.\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\nWhich you weep for.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nFeeling so the loss,\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death\n"
- "As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.\n\nJULIET.\nWhat villain, madam?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThat same villain Romeo.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nVillain and he be many miles asunder.\nGod pardon him. I do, with all my heart.\n"
- "And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nThat is because the traitor murderer lives.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAy madam, from the reach of these my hands.\nWould none but I might venge my cousin’s death."
- "\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\n"
- "Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,\nWhere that same banish’d runagate doth live,\n"
- "Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram\nThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company:\n"
- "And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIndeed I never shall be satisfied\nWith Romeo till I behold him—dead—\n"
- "Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.\nMadam, if you could find out but a man\n"
- "To bear a poison, I would temper it,\nThat Romeo should upon receipt thereof,\n"
- "Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\nTo hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,\n"
- "To wreak the love I bore my cousin\nUpon his body that hath slaughter’d him.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nFind thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.\n"
- "But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAnd joy comes well in such a needy time.\nWhat are they, I beseech your ladyship?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\nOne who to put thee from thy heaviness,"
- "\nHath sorted out a sudden day of joy,\nThat thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nMadam, in happy time, what day is that?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn\nThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\n"
- "The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,\nShall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNow by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride.\n"
- "I wonder at this haste, that I must wed\nEre he that should be husband comes to woo.\n"
- "I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\nI will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\n"
- "It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nHere comes your father, tell him so yourself,\n"
- "And see how he will take it at your hands.\n\n Enter Capulet and Nurse.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nWhen the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;\nBut for the sunset of my brother’s son\n"
- "It rains downright.\nHow now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\n"
- "Evermore showering? In one little body\nThou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.\n"
- "For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\nDo ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,\n"
- "Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,\nWho raging with thy tears and they with them,\n"
- "Without a sudden calm will overset\nThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\n"
- "Have you deliver’d to her our decree?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nAy, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\n"
- "I would the fool were married to her grave.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nSoft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.\n"
- "How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\nIs she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\n"
- "Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nNot proud you have, but thankful that you have.\nProud can I never be of what I hate;\n"
- "But thankful even for hate that is meant love.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nHow now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?\n"
- "Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;\nAnd yet not proud. Mistress minion you,\n"
- "Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\nBut fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next\n"
- "To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\n"
- "Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!\nYou tallow-face!\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nFie, fie! What, are you mad?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nGood father, I beseech you on my knees,\nHear me with patience but to speak a word.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nHang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!\n"
- "I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,\nOr never after look me in the face.\n"
- "Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.\nMy fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\n"
- "That God had lent us but this only child;\nBut now I see this one is one too much,\n"
- "And that we have a curse in having her.\nOut on her, hilding.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nGod in heaven bless her.\nYou are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nAnd why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,\nGood prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nI speak no treason.\n\nCAPULET.\nO God ye good-en!\n\nNURSE.\nMay not one speak?\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nPeace, you mumbling fool!\nUtter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,\nFor here we need it not."
- "\n\nLADY CAPULET.\nYou are too hot.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nGod’s bread, it makes me mad!\nDay, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,\n"
- "Alone, in company, still my care hath been\nTo have her match’d, and having now provided\n"
- "A gentleman of noble parentage,\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,\n"
- "Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,\nProportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,\n"
- "And then to have a wretched puling fool,\nA whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,\n"
- "To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,\nI am too young, I pray you pardon me.’\n"
- "But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me.\n"
- "Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.\n"
- "And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;\nAnd you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\n"
- "For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,\nNor what is mine shall never do thee good.\n"
- "Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIs there no pity sitting in the clouds,\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?\n"
- "O sweet my mother, cast me not away,\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week,\n"
- "Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nTalk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.\nDo as thou wilt, for I have done with thee."
- "\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?\nMy husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.\n"
- "How shall that faith return again to earth,\nUnless that husband send it me from heaven\n"
- "By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.\nAlack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems\n"
- "Upon so soft a subject as myself.\nWhat say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\n"
- "Some comfort, Nurse.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nFaith, here it is.\nRomeo is banished; and all the world to nothing\n"
- "That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.\nOr if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\n"
- "Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,\nI think it best you married with the County.\n"
- "O, he’s a lovely gentleman.\nRomeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\n"
- "Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\n"
- "I think you are happy in this second match,\nFor it excels your first: or if it did not,\n"
- "Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,\nAs living here and you no use of him.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nSpeakest thou from thy heart?\n\nNURSE.\nAnd from my soul too,\nOr else beshrew them both.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAmen.\n\nNURSE.\nWhat?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nWell, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\nGo in, and tell my lady I am gone,\n"
- "Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,\nTo make confession and to be absolv’d.\n\n"
- "NURSE.\nMarry, I will; and this is wisely done.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nAncient damnation! O most wicked fiend!\nIs it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,\n"
- "Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue\nWhich she hath prais’d him with above compare\n"
- "So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.\nThou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.\n"
- "I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.\nIf all else fail, myself have power to die.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n"
- "ACT IV\n\nSCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\n\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nOn Thursday, sir? The time is very short.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nMy father Capulet will have it so;\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nYou say you do not know the lady’s mind.\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk’d of love;\n"
- "For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\n"
- "That she do give her sorrow so much sway;\nAnd in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,\n"
- "To stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\n"
- "May be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\n[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—\n"
- "Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\n\n Enter Juliet.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nHappily met, my lady and my wife!\n\nJULIET.\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nThat may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.\n\nJULIET.\nWhat must be shall be.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThat’s a certain text.\n\nPARIS.\nCome you to make confession to this father?\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nTo answer that, I should confess to you.\n\nPARIS.\nDo not deny to him that you love me.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nI will confess to you that I love him.\n\nPARIS.\nSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIf I do so, it will be of more price,\nBeing spoke behind your back than to your face.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nPoor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThe tears have got small victory by that;\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nThou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nThy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own.\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\n"
- "Or shall I come to you at evening mass?\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—\n"
- "My lord, we must entreat the time alone.\n\n"
- "PARIS.\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!—\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,\n"
- "Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO shut the door, and when thou hast done so,\n"
- "Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief;\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\n"
- "I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nTell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\n"
- "If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise,\n"
- "And with this knife I’ll help it presently.\nGod join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;\n"
- "And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,\nShall be the label to another deed,\n"
- "Or my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\n"
- "Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,\nGive me some present counsel, or behold\n"
- "’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\n"
- "Which the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\n"
- "Be not so long to speak. I long to die,\nIf what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\n"
- "As that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris\n"
- "Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\n"
- "A thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop’st with death himself to scape from it.\n"
- "And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.\n\n"
- "JULIET.\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,\n"
- "Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;\n"
- "Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,\nO’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,\n"
- "With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave,\n"
- "And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,\n"
- "And I will do it without fear or doubt,\nTo live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHold then. Go home, be merry, give consent\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;\n"
- "Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,\nLet not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\n"
- "Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off,\n"
- "When presently through all thy veins shall run\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\n"
- "Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.\nNo warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,\n"
- "The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\nTo paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,\n"
- "Like death when he shuts up the day of life.\nEach part depriv’d of supple government,\n"
- "Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.\nAnd in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death\n"
- "Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\n"
- "Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\n"

- "FIRST WATCH.\nHold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\n\n"
- " Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.\n\n"
- "THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\n"
- "We took this mattock and this spade from him\nAs he was coming from this churchyard side.\n\n"
- "FIRST WATCH.\nA great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.\n\n Enter the Prince and Attendants.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nWhat misadventure is so early up,\nThat calls our person from our morning’s rest?\n\n"
- " Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.\n\nCAPULET.\nWhat should it be that they so shriek abroad?\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO the people in the street cry Romeo,\nSome Juliet, and some Paris, and all run\n"
- "With open outcry toward our monument.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?\n\n"
- "FIRST WATCH.\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,\nAnd Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,\n"
- "Warm and new kill’d.\n\nPRINCE.\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\n\n"
- "FIRST WATCH.\nHere is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\n"
- "These dead men’s tombs.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nO heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\n"
- "This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\n"
- "And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.\n\n"
- "LADY CAPULET.\nO me! This sight of death is as a bell\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\n\n"
- " Enter Montague and others.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up,\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\nGrief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.\n"
- "What further woe conspires against mine age?\n\nPRINCE.\nLook, and thou shalt see.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities,\n"
- "And know their spring, their head, their true descent,\nAnd then will I be general of your woes,\n"
- "And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\n"
- "Bring forth the parties of suspicion.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\n"
- "Doth make against me, of this direful murder.\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\n"
- "Myself condemned and myself excus’d.\n\nPRINCE.\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\n\n"
- "FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\n"
- "Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\n"
- "I married them; and their stol’n marriage day\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\n"
- "Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\n"
- "You, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce\n"
- "To County Paris. Then comes she to me,\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\n"
- "To rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\n"
- "Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\n"
- "As I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\n"
- "That he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\n"
- "Being the time the potion’s force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\n"
- "Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\n"
- "At the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\n"
- "Meaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\n"
- "But when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\n"
- "The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\n"
- "And bear this work of heaven with patience.\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\n"
- "And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\n"
- "All this I know; and to the marriage\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\n"
- "Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\n"
- "Unto the rigour of severest law.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\n\n"
- "BALTHASAR.\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\n"
- "To this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\n"
- "And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\n"
- "Sirrah, what made your master in this place?\n\n"
- "PAGE.\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\n"
- "Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\n"
- "And then I ran away to call the watch.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\n"
- "Their course of love, the tidings of her death.\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\n"
- "Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\n"
- "Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\n"
- "That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\n"
- "Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\n"
- "Can I demand.\n\n"
- "MONTAGUE.\nBut I can give thee more,\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\n"
- "That whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\n"
- "As that of true and faithful Juliet.\n\n"
- "CAPULET.\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\n\n"
- "PRINCE.\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\n"
- "Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\n"
- "For never was a story of more woe\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n\n [_Exeunt._]\n\n\n\n\n"
