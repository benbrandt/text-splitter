- "“And a Cockney, besides!” "
- "said Lucy, who had been further "

- "saddened by the Signora’s "
- " the Signora’s unexpected accent"
- " accent. “It might be London.” "
- "She looked at the two rows of "
- "the two rows of English people "
- " English people who were sitting"
- "who were sitting at the table; "
- " at the table; at the row of "
- ; at the row of white bottles of

- bottles of wine that ran between

- "“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too,"
- " you feel, too, that we might be"
- "that we might be in London? "
- "I can hardly believe that all "
- " that all kinds of other things "
- of other things are just outside
- "are just outside. "
- "I suppose it is one’s being so "
- " one’s being so tired.”\n\n"
- "“This meat has surely been used "

- ",” said Miss Bartlett, laying "

- "“I want so to see the Arno. "
- "The rooms the Signora promised "

- "The Signora had no business to "

- "Oh, it is a shame!”\n\n"
- "“Any nook does for me,” Miss "
- " for me,” Miss Bartlett "
- "” Miss Bartlett continued; “but "
- "continued; “but it does seem "
- " it does seem hard that you "
- " hard that you shouldn’t have a "

- "Lucy felt that she had been "
- " she had been selfish. "
- "“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me"
- "mustn’t spoil me:\n"
- "of course, you must look over "
- " must look over the Arno, too. "
- "I meant that. "
- "The first vacant room in the "

- The ladies’ voices grew animated
- " grew animated, and—if the sad "
- " and—if the sad truth be owned—a"
- truth be owned—a little peevish.
- " little peevish. "
- "They were tired, and under the "
- ", and under the guise of "
- " the guise of unselfishness they"

- "Some of their neighbours "

- "He said:\n\n"
- "“I have a view, I have a view.”"
- "\n\n"
- "Miss Bartlett was startled. "
- "Generally at a pension people "
- " pension people looked them over"
- "looked them over for a day or "
- " for a day or two before "
- " or two before speaking, and "
- " speaking, and often did not "
- " often did not find out that "
- " find out that they would “do” "
- "they would “do” till they had "
- "” till they had gone. "
- "She knew that the intruder was "
- " intruder was ill-bred, even "
- " ill-bred, even before she "
- "even before she glanced at him. "
- "He was an old man, of heavy "
- " man, of heavy build, with a "
- " build, with a fair, shaven face"
- ", shaven face and large eyes. "
- "There was something childish in "
- " childish in those eyes, though "
- " eyes, though it was not the "
- " it was not the childishness of "
- "childishness of senility.\n"
- "What exactly it was Miss "
- " it was Miss Bartlett did not "
- " did not stop to consider, for "
- " consider, for her glance passed"
- " glance passed on to his clothes"
- " to his clothes. "
- "These did not attract her. "
- He was probably trying to become
- trying to become acquainted with
- " acquainted with them before "
- " them before they got into the "
- " got into the swim. "
- "So she assumed a dazed "
- "assumed a dazed expression when "
- "expression when he spoke to her,"
- "he spoke to her, and then said: "
- " and then said: “A view? "
- "Oh, a view! "
- "How delightful a view is!”\n\n"
- "“This is my son,” said the old "
- ",” said the old man; “his name’s"
- "man; “his name’s George. "
- "He has a view too.”\n\n"
- "“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, "
- " Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy,"
- "repressing Lucy, who was about "
- ", who was about to speak.\n\n"
- "“What I mean,” he continued, “is"
- " continued, “is that you can "
- "is that you can have our rooms, "
- "have our rooms, and we’ll have "
- " and we’ll have yours. "
- "We’ll change.”\n\n"
- "The better class of tourist was "
- " of tourist was shocked at this,"
- "shocked at this, and sympathized"
- " and sympathized with the new-"
- " with the new-comers. "
- "Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened "
- " reply, opened her mouth as "
- " her mouth as little as possible"
- " as possible, and said “Thank "
- "and said “Thank you very much "
- " you very much indeed; that is "
- "indeed; that is out of the "
- " is out of the question.”\n\n"
- "“Why?” "
- "said the old man, with both "
- " man, with both fists on the "

- "“Because it is quite out of the "
- " out of the question, thank you."
- ", thank you.”\n\n"
- "“You see, we don’t like to take—"
- " like to take—” began Lucy. "
- Her cousin again repressed her.
- "\n\n"
- "“But why?” he persisted. "
- "“Women like looking at a view; "
- " at a view; men don’t.” "
- "And he thumped with his fists "
- " with his fists like a naughty "
- " like a naughty child, and "
- " child, and turned to his son,\n"
- "saying, “George, persuade them!”"
- "\n\n"
- "“It’s so obvious they should "
- " they should have the rooms,” "
- " the rooms,” said the son. "
- "“There’s nothing else to say.”\n\n"
- He did not look at the ladies as
- "at the ladies as he spoke, but "
- " he spoke, but his voice was "
- " his voice was perplexed and "
- " perplexed and sorrowful. "
- "Lucy, too, was perplexed; but "
- " perplexed; but she saw that "
- " she saw that they were in for "
- " were in for what is known as “"
- " is known as “quite a scene,” "
- "quite a scene,” and she had an "
- " and she had an odd feeling that"
- "odd feeling that whenever these "
- " whenever these ill-bred "
- " these ill-bred tourists spoke "
- " tourists spoke the contest "
- " the contest widened and "
- " widened and deepened till it "
- " till it dealt, not with rooms "
- " not with rooms and views, but "
- " and views, but with—well, with "
- "with—well, with something quite "
- "something quite different, whose"
- "different, whose existence she "
- " existence she had not realized "
- " not realized before. "
- "Now the old man attacked Miss "
- " attacked Miss Bartlett almost "
- "Bartlett almost violently: Why "
- " violently: Why should she not "
- " should she not change? "
- What possible objection had she?
- " had she? "
- "They would clear out in half an "
- " out in half an hour.\n\n"
- "Miss Bartlett, though skilled in"
- " skilled in the delicacies of "
- " delicacies of conversation, was"
- ", was powerless in the presence "
- "in the presence of brutality. "
- "It was impossible to snub any "
- " to snub any one so gross. "
- "Her face reddened with "
- " reddened with displeasure. "
- "She looked around as much as to "
- " as much as to say, “Are you all"
- ", “Are you all like this?” "
- "And two little old ladies, who "
- "old ladies, who were sitting "
- " were sitting further up the "
- " further up the table, with "
- "the table, with shawls hanging "
- " shawls hanging over the backs "
- " over the backs of the chairs, "
- " of the chairs, looked back, "

- "“Eat your dinner, dear,” she "
- ", dear,” she said to Lucy, and "
- " to Lucy, and began to toy again"
- " to toy again with the meat that"
- " the meat that she had once "

- "Lucy mumbled that those seemed "

- "Hardly had she announced this "

- "The curtains at the end of the "
- " the end of the room parted, and"
- "room parted, and revealed a "
- " and revealed a clergyman, stout"
- "clergyman, stout but attractive,"
- " but attractive, who hurried "

- "cheerfully apologizing for his "

- "Lucy, who had not yet acquired "

- "The view thence of Florence is "

- "It is the view that Alessio "

- "He was a member of the "

- " Florence which is denied to all"
- "is denied to all who carry in "

- Therefore an invitation from the

- "Between the two sections of his "
