/**
Plain-text splitter. Recursively splits chunks into the largest semantic units that fit within the chunk size. Also will attempt to merge neighboring chunks if they can fit within the given chunk size.

### By Number of Characters

```python
from semantic_text_splitter import TextSplitter

# Maximum number of characters in a chunk
max_characters = 1000
# Optionally can also have the splitter not trim whitespace for you
splitter = TextSplitter(max_characters)
# splitter = TextSplitter(max_characters, trim=False)

chunks = splitter.chunks("your document text")
```

### Using a Range for Chunk Capacity

You also have the option of specifying your chunk capacity as a range.

Once a chunk has reached a length that falls within the range it will be returned.

It is always possible that a chunk may be returned that is less than the `start` value, as adding the next piece of text may have made it larger than the `end` capacity.

```python
from semantic_text_splitter import TextSplitter


# Maximum number of characters in a chunk. Will fill up the
# chunk until it is somewhere in this range.
splitter = TextSplitter((200,1000))

chunks = splitter.chunks("your document text")
```

### Using a Hugging Face Tokenizer

```python
from semantic_text_splitter import TextSplitter
from tokenizers import Tokenizer

# Maximum number of tokens in a chunk
max_tokens = 1000
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
splitter = TextSplitter.from_huggingface_tokenizer(tokenizer, max_tokens)

chunks = splitter.chunks("your document text")
```

### Using a Tiktoken Tokenizer


```python
from semantic_text_splitter import TextSplitter

# Maximum number of tokens in a chunk
max_tokens = 1000
splitter = TextSplitter.from_tiktoken_model("gpt-3.5-turbo", max_tokens)

chunks = splitter.chunks("your document text")
```

### Using a Custom Callback

```python
from semantic_text_splitter import TextSplitter

splitter = TextSplitter.from_callback(lambda text: len(text), 1000)

chunks = splitter.chunks("your document text")
```

Args:
    capacity (int | (int, int)): The capacity of characters in each chunk. If a
        single int, then chunks will be filled up as much as possible, without going over
        that number. If a tuple of two integers is provided, a chunk will be considered
        "full" once it is within the two numbers (inclusive range). So it will only fill
        up the chunk until the lower range is met.
    overlap (int, optional): The maximum number of allowed characters to overlap between chunks.
        Defaults to 0.
    trim (bool, optional): Specify whether chunks should have whitespace trimmed from the
        beginning and end or not. If False, joining all chunks will return the original
        string. Defaults to True.

    Generate a list of chunks from a given text. Each chunk will be up to the `chunk_capacity`.


    ## Method

    To preserve as much semantic meaning within a chunk as possible, each chunk is composed of the largest semantic units that can fit in the next given chunk. For each splitter type, there is a defined set of semantic levels. Here is an example of the steps used:

    1. Split the text by a increasing semantic levels.
    2. Check the first item for each level and select the highest level whose first item still fits within the chunk size.
    3. Merge as many of these neighboring sections of this level or above into a chunk to maximize chunk length. Boundaries of higher semantic levels are always included when merging, so that the chunk doesn't inadvertantly cross semantic boundaries.

    The boundaries used to split the text if using the `chunks` method, in ascending order:

    1. Characters
    2. [Unicode Grapheme Cluster Boundaries](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries)
    3. [Unicode Word Boundaries](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Word_Boundaries)
    4. [Unicode Sentence Boundaries](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Sentence_Boundaries)
    5. Ascending sequence length of newlines. (Newline is `\r\n`, `\n`, or `\r`) Each unique length of consecutive newline sequences is treated as its own semantic level. So a sequence of 2 newlines is a higher level than a sequence of 1 newline, and so on.

    Splitting doesn't occur below the character level, otherwise you could get partial bytes of a char, which may not be a valid unicode str.

    Args:
        text (str): Text to split.

    Returns:
        A list of strings, one for each chunk. If `trim` was specified in the text
        splitter, then each chunk will already be trimmed as well.

/**
Markdown splitter. Recursively splits chunks into the largest semantic units that fit within the chunk size. Also will attempt to merge neighboring chunks if they can fit within the given chunk size.

### By Number of Characters

```python
from semantic_text_splitter import MarkdownSplitter

# Maximum number of characters in a chunk
max_characters = 1000
# Optionally can also have the splitter not trim whitespace for you
splitter = MarkdownSplitter()
# splitter = MarkdownSplitter(trim_chunks=False)

chunks = splitter.chunks("# Header\n\nyour document text", max_characters)
```

### Using a Range for Chunk Capacity

You also have the option of specifying your chunk capacity as a range.

Once a chunk has reached a length that falls within the range it will be returned.

It is always possible that a chunk may be returned that is less than the `start` value, as adding the next piece of text may have made it larger than the `end` capacity.

```python
from semantic_text_splitter import MarkdownSplitter

splitter = MarkdownSplitter()

# Maximum number of characters in a chunk. Will fill up the
# chunk until it is somewhere in this range.
chunks = splitter.chunks("# Header\n\nyour document text", chunk_capacity=(200,1000))
```

### Using a Hugging Face Tokenizer

```python
from semantic_text_splitter import MarkdownSplitter
from tokenizers import Tokenizer

# Maximum number of tokens in a chunk
max_tokens = 1000
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
splitter = MarkdownSplitter.from_huggingface_tokenizer(tokenizer)

chunks = splitter.chunks("# Header\n\nyour document text", max_tokens)
```

### Using a Tiktoken Tokenizer


```python
from semantic_text_splitter import MarkdownSplitter

# Maximum number of tokens in a chunk
max_tokens = 1000
splitter = MarkdownSplitter.from_tiktoken_model("gpt-3.5-turbo")

chunks = splitter.chunks("# Header\n\nyour document text", max_tokens)
```

### Using a Custom Callback

```python
from semantic_text_splitter import MarkdownSplitter

# Optionally can also have the splitter trim whitespace for you
splitter = MarkdownSplitter.from_callback(lambda text: len(text))

# Maximum number of tokens in a chunk. Will fill up the
# chunk until it is somewhere in this range.
chunks = splitter.chunks("# Header\n\nyour document text", chunk_capacity=(200,1000))
```

Args:
    capacity (int | (int, int)): The capacity of characters in each chunk. If a
        single int, then chunks will be filled up as much as possible, without going over
        that number. If a tuple of two integers is provided, a chunk will be considered
        "full" once it is within the two numbers (inclusive range). So it will only fill
        up the chunk until the lower range is met.
    overlap (int, optional): The maximum number of allowed characters to overlap between chunks.
        Defaults to 0.
    trim (bool, optional): Specify whether chunks should have whitespace trimmed from the
        beginning and end or not. If False, joining all chunks will return the original
        string. Defaults to True.

    Generate a list of chunks from a given text. Each chunk will be up to the `chunk_capacity`.

    ## Method

    To preserve as much semantic meaning within a chunk as possible, each chunk is composed of the largest semantic units that can fit in the next given chunk. For each splitter type, there is a defined set of semantic levels. Here is an example of the steps used:

    1. Split the text by a increasing semantic levels.
    2. Check the first item for each level and select the highest level whose first item still fits within the chunk size.
    3. Merge as many of these neighboring sections of this level or above into a chunk to maximize chunk length. Boundaries of higher semantic levels are always included when merging, so that the chunk doesn't inadvertantly cross semantic boundaries.

    The boundaries used to split the text if using the `chunks` method, in ascending order:

    1. Characters
    2. [Unicode Grapheme Cluster Boundaries](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries)
    3. [Unicode Word Boundaries](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Word_Boundaries)
    4. [Unicode Sentence Boundaries](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Sentence_Boundaries)
    5. Soft line breaks (single newline) which isn't necessarily a new element in Markdown.
    6. Inline elements such as: text nodes, emphasis, strong, strikethrough, link, image, table cells, inline code, footnote references, task list markers, and inline html.
    7. Block elements suce as: paragraphs, code blocks, footnote definitions, metadata. Also, a block quote or row/item within a table or list that can contain other "block" type elements, and a list or table that contains items.
    8. Thematic breaks or horizontal rules.
    9. Headings by level

    Markdown is parsed according to the Commonmark spec, along with some optional features such as GitHub Flavored Markdown.
